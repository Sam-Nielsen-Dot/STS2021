# PLAN

1. Make a bunch of different datasets and document the process by which they were selected (e.g. use different search keywords, sentiment analysis refinement, random or positive nor depressed data)
2. Train models on each dataset and output to .pickle files
3. Test each model for accuracy on training/testing data, accuracy on a dataset of posts from a depression forum and accuracy on posts from a selection of handpicked "depressed" users
4. Find the best one and output it into an pypi package
