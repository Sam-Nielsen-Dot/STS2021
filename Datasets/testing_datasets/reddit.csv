"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them."|1
"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, please ask us.  

********

**Please keep in mind that no activism, i.e.  advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues, is ever allowed here.**  

It's not that we're against activism.  We're strongly in favour of it.  But we've learned the hard way that it doesn't work within a dedicated support space, so with regret, we can't allow it any more.  Thanks for understanding.  *Please report any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's mainly about a cause or an issue rather than a request for personal support.*

*****

**Despite the fact that we always maintain a sticky post about it, we're still seeing a lot of violations of the private contact policy.  Please read /r/depression/wiki/private_contact and report any violations that you see.**  Widespread disregard of this important rule causes trouble for both helpers and vulnerable OPs, wastes our time, and delays the improvements we're making to the community resources."|1
I have PTSD and a really shittu nightmare triggered a depressive episode and following advice from my therapist I reached out to a couple friends to talk to, 2 of them made plans with me then canceled. Which made me feel worse, so I tried contacting other friends and they either aren't available or Don get it. So instead of helping, I now feel passively suicidal and I just want a hug. I feel like everyone pretends to be supportive about mental health until you actually need help.|1
"I know that this problem has probably been mentionned multiple times on this sub, but for god sake this fucking capitalistic society depresses me so much that i have to vent about it somewhere where i won't be judged by all those wage-slaves IRL who are so proud of themselves because they are literally selling their time + body to an employer that doesn't give a shit about them. The only reason i'm even working is because it's still mandatory.

But then i was also thinking about seeing a therapist for this, but then i'm also like : but that's so stupid lol ? Like what the hell is he/she going to do about it ? Like i wonder how the hell therapist are suppose to help mentaly ill people that are sick because of the way society is structured ?

For me therapy seems like putting a bandage on an open wound in that case, because therapists are only going to threat the consequences that this sick capitalistic society have on people (anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts) but then the cause will still remain the same. That seems like such a waste of time and money for me, but i don't know what do you guys think ?

Like i don't know how most people can be so naively enthusiastic and thrilled about the fact that we have to work at least 8 hours a day, 5 days a week for 45 + years and then retire and slowly die at home once we're too old to work ?  How is this a normal way to be living life ? Like you gotta be some kind of masochistic person to enjoy suffering that way and for such a long time.

And also how fucking sad is it that humans are literaly the only living species that need to ""earn"" the right to live by working their asses off ? Why the fuck can't we just chill and do our own thing at home with our friends and family ? Why do we have to work for some international company owned by a psychopath/sociopath of a CEO that doesn't give a fuck about us ?

We have to pay for everything in this cursed capitalistic society : food, water, shelter, education, medication and a lot of other things for fuck sake soon enough we're gonna have to pay for the oxygen that we're breathing.

And i don't mean that society is the only cause of my depression, they are probably other things as well that are causing it, but i still think that it plays a huge part in worsening it.

EDIT : wow thank you guys so much for giving so many upvotes i really didn't expect this topic to be so popular !"|1
I am tired. The kind of tired that won't go away no matter how much I try. No rest, no love, no affection, no sunshine can penetrate through that tiredness. How did I end up like this?|1
I wish someone could heal me.|1
Sometimes I’ll have pretty normal days. I’ll tell myself, oh that phase was stupid now that I can think clear again. Then the depression hits (usually once a month for a couple days) and I’ll wonder: is there something truly wrong with me, or is the rest of the world blindly following a herd of others in denial? Idk. I think about this often, and felt like sharing.|1
"The only thing I like about myself is my appearance. I do like my personality somewhat but I doubt it will attract a lot of people since I'm ""tomboyish"". I do hate some parts of myself so much though. When I was growing up, I was never taught how to cook, clean, fold clothes, put a helmet on, put pictures on the wall and other basic things. I am terrible at working too since I can never do things right. I also suffer from a hand eye coordination disorder so it makes everything worse. Ptsd also made my brain fog worse and now I dissociate. I don't have that many hobbies either. 

I want a relationship where I can feel safe in. Someone who accepts me for who I am and is willing to help me become a better me but I doubt I'll ever be ""enough"" for someone because of how many flaws I have that I know I won't able to overcome in years. I'm so fucking lonely."|1
Everyone is going outside to do stuff with their friends and I am here with no friends stuck inside watching tv. There is honestly no point in living when you have nobody to do things with. I am such a failure.|1
"Life during my 20s and 30s really killed my enthusiasm to want to do anything. When I was a teen a lost my dad. My mom walked out on me not long after that. Her depression got to the point she couldn't function. We lost everything. That was my main driving force for getting out of the situation I was in. I couldn't afford college back then so I just went straight to work. The problem with that was I ended up in a job during the recession that paid very little. My boss was abusive and very manipulative. I couldn't just quit because I had nowhere to go. No family to go live with. I was alone. I finally got a better job later on so I decided to start trying to seriously date. The girl I was dating cheated on me the same week my mom died in the hospital. I blame myself for not being there for my mom in the end. I was too busy trying to figure out what was going on with the relationship I was in at the time. I didn't think she would die but she did anyway. My ex aborted our child that same week. I ended up giving a eulogy to a bunch of empty chairs. No one bothered to show up. I just pretended my mom could hear me. Life was horrible. 

I have no desire to do anything now. I have a decent job finally but there is so much more I could be doing with my life. Being in my 40s now I have lost all energy to attempt to do anything other than just work or come home. I have no desire to have children. I would hate for them to go through what I did if I passed away. I just don't trust any woman that would date me would be a good mother. Having no family and no one in your life really takes all the drive for life away."|1
Everything I do is a lie. The way I act is a lie. If I was honest with myself and honest with everyone else they’d all hate me. I have it better than everyone else but I still act like I have any reason to be sad. I’ve never had to struggle to achieve anything everything’s been given to me from day one. Everyone tells me that I deserve happiness but then they’ll go and criticize people exactly like me. If they knew the real me they’d want me dead. But instead I just lie and lie and have forced myself into a certain way of thinking because I don’t want to accept that I’m wrong and a bad person.|1
Let’s assume there was a god for a second. Why is he sitting up there watching us all suffer in a world that he created? Why is there so much pain and depression on this stupid rock in this dumb ass universe? What is the point to life and why would someone in their right mind create a world like this one? My mom’s very Christian and the thought of there being a god and a satan has always been funny to me. If there was actually a god then why would he even allow satan to exist? Why are there little kids with excruciating diseases? Why are there even diseases and disabilities? Why is the world so unequal in terms or rich vs poor, black vs white, western countries vs third world countries? Nothing makes sense anymore.|1
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA IM SO FUCK7NG LONELY AAAAAAA I EILL KILL MYSELF SOON AAAAAAAÄA|1
Whenever I talk to anybody I can’t help but get super nervous and I always just go quiet cause Im scared to talk to them. It feels like it puts a barrier between me and people that can’t be crossed even my doctor said I was gonna have it my whole life. I’m just to awkward to be accepted into any group so I tell myself I don’t need anymore and that I should just be alone. I honestly could handle it and come to terms with that but whenever I see a group of friends having fun or a couple enjoining each other I just think about all the stuff I’m missing cause I’m to scared to talk to people.|1
I can't deal. Every day another feat of stupidity. Not counting the days when I have multiple f*** ups. I have nothing going for me. I wish I was dead.|1
I don’t know MOM maybe it’s because I fucking have diagnosed depression???|1
"If I don’t absolutely force myself I just do barely anything. Just laying around feeling empty or sad, how I waste my time.

And I’m also so annoyed by people around me telling me what specifically I need to do, to make it better. Well guess what, I won’t do any of these specific things, because I’m just laying around barely getting up to brush my teeth.

Fuck, I hate myself and this whole shitty waste of a life..."|1
I miss the way i felt when i was a child and how i viewed everything around me with much more colour, now everything feels grey, shit & dull. The person i used to be, people i had around me the enjoyment of experiencing things like socialising, gaming and every other hobby. The worst feeling is knowing that i probably won't ever feel that way about anything anymore|1
"I wanted to share this since no one in my life would get it and/or care. 

First, I cut up the watermelon that I’ve had sitting on my counter for the last week.

Second, I also made potato salad.

As “trivial” these tasks may seem, I am going to try to be more compassionate to my self and recognize them as the wins they are."|1
"My life is amazing. My wife and I make 1% money, have a great house, 2 dogs, kids that are just superlative. My son has been doing virtual school for the past 2 years, (Thanks COVID) so I've gotten to share an office with him. He's an amazing hockey player and a brilliant kid. My daughter is curious and furious and suffers no bullshit. 

I feel completely alone. My wife is always at work. I want to talk to people, but my life has nothing worth talking about, just the accomplishments of other people.  I don't even know how to reach out anymore. I've become socially incompetent.  I keep reaching out, hoping for someone to talk to, but I must be doing something wrong because none of my friends have anything to share.  I'm not suicidal, but just incredibly frustrated. 

It feels like I've forgotten how to be happy and thankful for the life that I have. Every moment I sit here trying to capture some sort of meaning or a sense of self. There's nothing there. My son asked me if I could do anything, what I would do. I had no answer. There's no ambition, no drive, no destination of my own anymore.  The only successes I can imagine are other people's. There's no dream for myself, just pulling the cart until I can lay down for good.  

I can't make it through a full episode of a show on Netflix. Movies are out of the question. My mind becomes restless and frustrated. I exercise, and I have no idea why.  I want there to be meaning again, but I have no idea how to find it. I feel like I've missed any shot at being anything other than (x)'s (y).  I chose to support my wife in becoming a doctor, to take care of the kids. I don't begrudge them the attention they deserve nor will I deprive them of the opportunities we can give them. I willingly took up the supporting role. Maybe I'm just being selfish for feeling unfilfilled, since she's accomplished quite a lot, and my kids are doing well. I just wish I could find any joy in all of this. I don't know why I can't.  Instead, I sit in silence trying to find any kind of validation of my own. 

How am I such a failure?"|1
"
How can I find someone who knows about eating disorders depression etc to talk to right now and not some shitty hotline that just regurgitates a script? 

I really think I need it my therapists aren’t available"|1
"I [21F] work in healthcare taking care of people with traumatic brain injuries. I’m burnt out. I have almost no social life and I dislike a lot of the people I’m “friends” with. My boyfriend works opposite schedules so I barely see him. My family is unhealthy and I can’t be around them. 

I work 40+ hours a week. My clients are my life. I’m sick of being screamed at, the target for throwing things, and wiping ass.  I’ve done this for 2 years and I’m sick of it. I have an apartment though and I’m breaking even every month so if I quit I’ll end up on the street. I would never hurt anyone but I think about hurting them sometimes. They are exhausting, ungrateful, mean, and I am their doormat and maid every day.  It’s not how I imagined I’d live my life. 

On my days off I’m exhausted. I sit around in the same spot all day. I nap my days away. It feels like I have nothing to really live for.  If I see friends they usually are rude in some capacity and I wait for them to leave. 

I’m taking a break from school because I don’t know if I want to do social work anymore. I’m almost done with my undergrad but it’s just too much with the pandemic. 

I’m lonely and bored. My entire life I’ve tried to be a good kid. It doesn’t really result in much. 

I am on the verge of buying a gun and holding it up to someone just so that they can call the cops and I can be arrested. That would be exciting.  Maybe I’ll find purpose there. 

I’ve always had depression but it’s hard to control. I feel impulsive but I’m too tired to follow through."|1
ITS HELL GUYS,HELLLLLLLLLLL|1
"I tend to get depressed after hanging out with people. Once everyone leaves and I'm alone, I start to spiral and worry about how I acted, what isaid, who I was. I just spiral and get depressed which sucks because I can havea really fun time but I'm so scared of what comes after.

Hell, even now I'm still hanging out with friends but I'm starting to get anxious about going to bed and being alone. I'm already worried about being depressed. I hate that this is how I am. I I hate everything about it and it's such bullshit that I have to be this way. I should be happy. I have a great life but I still hate it. I'm scared."|1
"
So my whole life ive been cold hearted towards my family and people in general to life especially.. although i change when its a person i love, someone thats new in my life that i specially have a place in a heart.. my friend recently got in a relationship and ive always been the person to talk to a lot of girls instead of keeping it lowkey with just one.. as he did it i felt some type of sadness which was never the case and so I started crying, again i never done that... I just feel like I made mistakes i shouldnt have done and I ruined my reputation.. they look at me like someone else but in reality i would love and treat and be nice, caring towards the loved person although no trusts me.. not even my best friend.... I NEED HELP, im numb 😞"|1
"Once that love you had for each other leaves it’s never commg back.

Sex life declines, stop going out and having fun, multiple break ups, other people.

At what point do you leave? 

At what point will 2 people be honest with themselves instead of continuing because it’s comfortable. 

Damn shame"|1
I've been depressed for over two years. My depression caused me to put a pause on college so I could recover, but I'm not recovering. It doesn't help to have therapy and I'm on medications which don't help. I'm trying new ones but I'm not feeling better yet. A few weeks ago my depression lessened and tricked me into thinking I'd recovered finally only to relapse almost immediately to a point where I felt worse than ever before. My mood is increasingly unstable and it's common to feel suicidal several times a day. I spend a lot of my time in bed even though it makes me feel worse but I didn't get accepted when I applied to jobs that people said I would feel better having so I would have something to do. I feel like I'm running out of options and I don't want to feel this way anymore. I'm losing my purpose and I'm so lonely and unwilling to do anything and in so much pain please advise.|1
Internet venting might not bring any tangible positive change into my life but it sure does feel good|1
I've struggled with depression for ten years, and despite my efforts, nothing gets better. Rather, the pile of shit in my life just keeps growing. I've gone to mental institutions several times over the last decade to address this problem only to lose good friendships and go into bankruptcy as a direct consequence for trying to fix myself. I have no loved ones anymore, everybody is either dead or has moved away from me. I have no motivation to try anything anymore, and I dont know how to address this. I understand giving up is the worst thing I can do, but can it truly be worse than trying to no avail?|1
"I feel truly alone. I have two best girl friends, I text them because I'm really feeling bad, and it takes hours for them to reply. Sometimes I see them online even.

I met a guy, he said he liked me, I didn't at first but then I shared the same feelings, but now he's ignoring me, lost all interest it seems. This happens all the time.

I can't talk to my grandma about my feelings because she's 88, she's sick, she doesn't need to carry my problems. I can't talk to my mom because she has 4 personality disorders and this would make her be even worse.

I feel truly alone. Like no one likes me, loves me, or is capable of listening to me. I'm never the first option, I'm never special, I'm always giving and feel like I get nothing back. And I constantly remember all the times people left me alone, lied to me, used me. 

I'm so tired of everything. Because even when I try, I fail. I have been studying hard since March for a test I had today. Out of 15 questions, I answered correctly 4 (it was a multiple option test). I feel that I'm so stupid, so gullible believing good things will happen to me, believing I'll find love, I'll get good grades, I'll make friends, believing in intelligent when I'm not.

I'm just tired, of trying, and trying, and the only thing that makes me truly happy right now it's just having a nice meal. I'm a chubby girl so I later on feel like crap, obviously, so happiness lasts maybe twenty minutes.

I want to feel loved, cared, I want to feel like I matter. 😞"|1
"TW//mention of animal dying 

A weird but very true thought. I get anxiety thinking about it as my emotional support dogs (6M, 9F) get up in age. They make day to day and existential suffering easier and worth living... (I feel so childish to say that but it’s absolutely true.) They show me the love that I used to think family, friends, and relationships provide. (I also have trauma experiencing a family member of mine accidentally killing my dog as a teenager.)

Am I suicidal? No, absolutely not. What’s the point of this post? I kind of just wanted to put this out there into the internet abyss, if anyone relates. I really don’t know how I would be getting on in life in my current circumstances without my dogs. They are the only emotional support in my life lol 

I’ve been having a very hard time lately. Getting through it best I know how. 

TLDR dog appreciation post. Family n friends n relationships suck lol"|1
"im 15, male, barely 5'4, smart, weird, and generally an awful unattractive person.

life sucks ass for me. I'm worthless. I've been bullied all my life, and its been really bad lately.

Its the worst feeling ever. I've tried to change so many things about myself, but the things people hate me for are the things i can't change.

My school is having a dance at the end of this year. i worked up the courage to ask this two girls out, one just did a 180 and walked away when I asked her, and the other just laughed. that just proves to me how worthless I am.

i don't get it. I don't hate anyone, but everyone seems to want to see me dead. I'm always getting told to kill myself and other shit, and i just can't take it. Its not like ill ever get revenge, so i guess ill just end it all.

y'all win. you're getting your wish, I'm going to kill myself.

ill write on my note that i want to be ground up and have my fat turned into soap. ill at least be worth something to society that way."|1
"i guess i reached my breaking point. 

2 weeks ago, i lost my apartment, i became homeless and i was forced to couch surf until im able to find a place to live. well, today i decided to go to a party and forget my sorrows, the past 12 months have treated me very badly and some company would help me get over that. No. ive never felt more lonely in my life. i wasnt able to connect with anyone at all, i felt so lonely, i didnt have the ability to start a conversation with anyone and nobody really cared for me. At that point i realized that life to me has no meaning, i have no place to live, no friends, no family, no job, nothing. i wish i was never born. i wish i could just die right now. life isnt for me. my resentment towards my parents grows with every passing day."|1
"A series of somewhat upsetting (yet *traumatic* for me) events have recently occurred that have just sent me into a spiral. Becoming a mother/having postpartum right before the pandemic of course started it but over the course of the year, a number of things in succession on top of this have contributed to me thinking about how we die, there is nothing, I wish there WAS something else but the devastating things that happen in this world show me there’s no way that can be true. The world was here billions of years before me, it will be here billions of era after me and we’re just marching on. Now everything is triggering - anything remotely sad, any mention of death - I can’t. I feel so hopeless. I feel like death is everywhere, scared while driving or walking or even in my home (not unusual for me but definitely exacerbated).

I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety but this is another level. COULD THIS JUST BE A MATTER OF MEDS?! Please tell me there’s a solution, I want to go back to being distracted from constantly thinking about my fate and how devastating the world/life is."|1
"I've been completely isolated during the pandemic, except for my parents. When it started I hunkered down and never came back up. I found an online job and I didn't even go into grocery stores. In a screwed up way I convinced myself I had found solidarity in this way of life.

Now, I'm vaccinated. My friends have been calling me, my parents insisting I should get out and get a better in-person job. 

When I look at the mirror I see a sad, empty shell of what I used to be, which wasn't much to begin with. I don't want people to see how much I've changed. I can't laugh anymore or make small talk. I don't want people in crowds to see what a disgusting, useless pile of crap that I am. I just want to stay at my home desk and do what I've been doing for 13 months. I have trouble even walking my dog around the neighborhood...I feel like people look at me and think about how useless I am. Every fiber of my being just wants to stay in my room, because it's the only safe space I've had for so long. I don't know how the hell some people have been able to just go on living the way they did in 2019 after being vaccinated."|1
"Thinking it could be helpful to converse with someone else who is in the process of putting his/her life back together after a long period of depression and isolation.

I’ve been mired in a severe depressive episode for 7 years and am just starting to come out of it now.

Can share more details when we connect.

For several years I didn’t have any sense of loneliness, I was just trying to hang on, and now that feeling of loneliness is starting to return, and I guess I’m interested in talking with somebody else who may be going thru somewhat similar circumstances.

I’m looking for someone who is compassionate and supportive, which is also what I think I offer as a recovery partner as well.

I have no plans for this weekend so I’ll be around to chat/talk.

We can start with an online chat or voice chat, but I’d like to progress to voice chatting/phone conversations because I feel that will be the most helpful medium in terms of the recovery process.

I am very big on privacy and respectful of your wishes to remain anonymous if that’s important to you.

So if there is anybody out there who is trying to recover from depression, is struggling with loneliness, and is looking for a recovery buddy of sorts, please feel free to reply."|1
"I hate myself because it’s easy,            
I use it to numb the pain.

These thoughts get worse when I’m uncomfortable,                     
Sometimes it feels like my only escape. 

I know I probably shouldn’t,              
And I know it’s probably unjustified,            
But after all the lying and confusion,           
I can’t help but say,                     

I hate myself."|1
I suffered from depression for the most of my youth and all my teens, and it ultimately influenced the person I am now. Everyone would assure me that things would get better as I got older and that I would be able to manage it one day. Well, even at the age of 21, I still struggle to get out of bed and accomplish anything constructive, and I'm not sure how much longer I can actually deal with this way of life. I do have a support system in the form of my parents and my partner, whom mean the entire world to me, but aside from them, I have no one. I'd like to have my own group of friends with whom I can hang out and have fun, but I'm not sure how to go about it now that I'm an adult. And with my mental illness its harder to find people and cultivate that kind of bond ya know. It's been years since I've felt like I could call someone a friend, and I'm not going to lie, that shit fuckin hurts, especially on a Saturday night. I just feel like my depression and anxiety robbed me of so much in my teens, and it's happening again in my twenties Haha.|1
I’m tired of constantly having to fend for myself.  It’s a nice day where I live and I’m too tired to get out.  I tried to make plans but everyone is already busy.  The person I’m dating works all the time and we rarely see each other.   I feel like I’m doomed to have a normal, fulfilling life.  I do my best to put myself out there and be social, but I still get stuck being isolated.|1
Long story short I did some dirty stuff on the phone cause I felt alone it’s my birthday  and I feel so alone and unwanted but I know I’m wasted just my girlfriend isn’t at fault I am for being so damn dumb and broken these last relationship really changed how I felt and feel how much I don’t care about others but it changed a while ago . But I always fall back into my old ways . You can hate me I should be hated, so we where talking and we called and I was showering and she got naked cause I ask but I hesitated to show my self this time and I was just not it anymore cause I already was feeling moody and I took care of it quickly but after that I hung up cause I knew I didn’t want this I didn’t want to be this person I want to be the good version of me to do that I need to be better and I told her and I hurt her feelings we barley knew each other but still it’s not excuse to hurt her . I don’t want to lose my girlfriend if I tell her I will I’m  only 20 but it’s no excuse for what I’ve done .  I hate my self and I’m going to a program soon to help depression and stuff but I feel like such a bad person .|1
"I'm a guy in my 30's and I think I have body dysmorphia and OCD about photos along with extreme low self-esteem. Advice would be really appreciated please.

I am trying to put a new perspective on things so I am not entirely blaming myself all the time.

I have had long term chronic mental and physical health issues and it just seems they pile up on top of each other as life goes on. I just keep thinking 'how much more can go wrong'? And I feel pathetic for feeling the way I do.

But j have had a long term issue with photos. I have some kind of OCD with photos where I feel I have to take them all the time almost as if I'm afraid of the moment slipping away. And I feel like I have to be in them to prove I was there but then I hate myself in photos so much it is a constant obsession and my reaction when I see them is as if it's the worst thing in the world. My whole world and thoughts are all consumed by the thought of me in those photo and how awful I look. So I try not to take them but then my whole time is spent full of anxiety I'm not recording my life.

It's gotten to the point where I can't enjoy any occasion because I'm so worried about needing to take photos and full of anxiety if I don't but then days/weeks/months/years are ruined by seeing myself in the photos. 

It's some weird juxtaposing fear and anxiety that I can't control because stopping one causes the other. 

But not only that, I have to be in control of the pictures. If someone else is taking a picture I freak out and have this conflicting need to not be in it but also to bit miss out on the memory. So then when it's taken and I see it, I hate it so much that it controls my thoughts completely and the fact someone else has possession and control over that image makes it so much worse.

Also, my friends laugh at me because they say I'm exactly the same in every photo. It's because I'm so hyper aware of a camera I stop whatever I'm doing and try to smile and look 'nice' for the photo as I know if I look bad it'll control my thoughts for ever. So I have a fake cheesy grin that no matter how much i tell myself not to do I can't help it. It's like someone is threatening me with a camera and it's my only way of reacting.

So my bad photos are brought to everyone's attention and laughed it because of my actions. And it makes me just as anxious and distressed that I look like this in every photo for my whole adult life as everyone else looks natural and different and it's truly depicting that moment. And there's me creepily staring at the camera wide eyed, fearful and smiling in every picture. It makes me think I don't have any true pictures of what I looked like in that moment and I've ruined all those memories myself. 

I was at a BBQ today and was ok but then some photos were taken and people were laughing at how I looked identical in every photo again and I felt this dark cloud over me and my anxiety and depression took over. I will now dwell on those photos for days and weeks. I even have photos I am still feeling traumatised by years and years after. 

I've not had the chance to talk about it as I'm an older man and nobody would take me seriously. They would think it's ridiculous and pathetic and that's exactly how I feel about myself but it is all encompassing and it is controlling and ruining my life.

Can I tell myself I have body dysmorphia do you think? Does this sound like that and can anyone relate?

I just feel like I've ruined my life and over something so pathetic. It genuinely makes me suicidal and hopeless."|1
I honestly don’t feel like a person anymore. I do things mindlessly. It’s all second nature at this point. I zone out so much, even when I’m at work. Honestly, my job doesn’t need that much focus to be performed. I keep getting this visions of myself bashing my head against the wall or hanging from the ceiling. I’m always feel like I’m close to a breakdown. And my moods can flip like a switch. Nothing in this world can help me and it fucking sucks. I’m so tired of feeling this way. I just wish that I wasn’t too fucking scared to pull the trigger and end it all.|1
there's a recurring theme where I give my everything to make my friend's life better and to know they are appreciated, I remember their stories, requests and I try to please them as much as I can because they make me happy and I want them to be happy too. but they don't do the same, I guess in the same time I can hope much from them because I'm not living their life, but I just feel sometimes like im trying my best and when I ask them to do something simple for me they never do it, for example, save me a seat in class so I wouldn't sit next to someone I don't want to or reschedule a movie when I cant (I reschedule if someone cant). I'm prob just sounding selfish ;(|1
"(this is more of a rant than anything else)

I have depression since I'm 15. It started when I experienced a traumatic event that changed my way of seeing life. Since then, I just hate every bit of living. I got to therapy when I was 18, things started to get better and I begun to understand my sexuality, stuff like that. 

I moved from my parents house, because they were a source of my sadness, got in a gay relationship and I never felt better. But then my depression got worse, I started to drink and use drugs, my gf was draining me, and when I reached the worst point in my life, she broke up with me. I started to drink even more, smoke more, party more, to try to forget. 

One year later and I finally got over her, but was drinking and smoking like usual. I got my graduation, an amazing job and friends that I loved. I still was using drugs tho. 

Then, one day, I met a guy who I dated when I was 14. He's really cool and sweet, we started to talk again and when I realized we were dating again. He helped me stop with my addiction to alcohol and drugs, I stopped with my self destruct behavior, started to eat more and to enjoy life without being intoxicated. But with this, I also lost some friends. They didn't liked the changes I made in my life, I guess. 

Now I'm in a new city with my husband. I don't know anyone here and I spend my days in my house, working, playing, sleeping, repeat. And today I got really depressed with this. Suddenly, I want that old life back, that life where I just smoke and snort and drink till I forget my name, where I sit with my friends to play DnD and drink and smoke more. And I know I can't have this back, so i just wanted to die already, it's easier, I don't need to worry with anything if I'm dead. 

But this is so pathetic, why would my depression get back when I have a happy family with my husband, a good work, good house, I have a PC and I play my favorite games. Why would I wish to live like a drunk and high on every known drug anorexic girl again? Why do I want so much to destroy myself?"|1
Couldn’t do it. Too much of a coward. I know deep down that I don’t want to live and that it’s only my natural instincts of self preservation that make it so difficult to end my life but after a few failed attempts I’m genuinely starting to get worried that I may never be able to kilo myself. How have so many before me been so courageous? I am so jealous of anyone who was ever strong enough to take their own life. I hope to be able to overcome this soon. I want to die so badly.|1
"I feel like most people who compliment me just don't know me that well. I see so much wrong in me, when people say they're proud of me I tell myself they're either ignorant or lying.

Worst of all is my wife. She says she's proud of me because I'm exercising more, and that she can really see a difference in me. But she's yelled at me so many times, even told me outright that I obviously don't care about fitness — even while I was actively at the gym — that it all feels totally empty. I'm afraid to believe anything nice she says, because every time I do I end up making her angry and she basically comes out and says the opposite of all her compliments. She says I should be proud of myself, but I'm afraid that if I am I'll just make her angry again. I feel like hating myself is the only way I can actually motivate myself to do anything worthwhile. The only way to earn my wife's affection is by despising myself."|1
Mom just told me she’d kill my dog if I ever got one, even though I think it’s necessary for my mental health.|1
i’m sorry but moms fucking suck ass when it comes to mental health. that’s all my mom does with all the problems i face in life, she always downplays them because “there’s worse than that”. being a teenager and having mental health issues is so complicated because ultimately you have to pass through your parents when it comes to that kind of stuff. what am i supposed to do man??|1
"Title says it. I am not super depressed, but I cannot remember the last time I was super happy and not super stoned...

It kind of reminds me of The Good Life Finale. Maybe I am just tired of wanting, of needing, and of striving.

Given a long enough life, we all realize that eventually the only thing that keeps us going is ""want.""

I just know that want is not worth living for. I, as a person, am not special. None of us are. People who are famous/special today are forgotten tomorrow. We all are.

Think of all the famous people of the 1500's that are lost to time. All the beauty, the charming, and the artistry. Gone, forever.

I used to love the liberation of being insignificant. That the very fact that the world doesn't care about our normal stories makes us all special, in a unique hipster kind of way. Like, I am super cool because I knew their story before you did, kind of way.

Now I am understanding the endgame. Life is full of want, until we don't. 

I am just approaching the ""don't"" point.

Sorry everyone for being a downer, but it just feels like the one thing that I don't ""want"" to be as well."|1
"I don't even really know where to post this I just don't know what to do it thus is a bad place for this I'll just delete it.

I'm home schooled with really bad social anxiety so it's basically impossible at least in my current mental state to make friends on real life so I kind of rely on the Internet to socialize. I have 1 proper really great friend on Online, I've known them about 9 nearly 10 months which I guess isn't that long but we know really personal stuff about each other and I've shared stuff with them that I've told no one else. The main problem I have is alll my mental issues effect our friendship for: I overthink literally everything that happens, I'm always worried they'll stop liking me for whatever reason and I'm super insecure like if they're playing with other friends it makes me feel really bad or not good enough.

 I havent said any of this to them because I know it's my problems and I don't want them to feel like a problem. I've looked at stuff about my situation and the solution is generally just ""grow up"" but I just don't know how to improve."|1
"(please ignore. I'm not currently in any harm at all. I just want to scream into the void. I have no clue why. It doesn't make me feel better. People replying or not doesn't change anything or make me feel any certain way. I'm just waiting for laundry)

I want to die.
I want to kill myself.
I want to end it all and don't care at all what I might be missing.
I want to kick the bucket.
I want to rest forever.
I prefer if I wasn't been born at all but immediate death is an acceptable alternative.
I don't want to try and fix it, I'd rather just die.
I don't want to wait and trust that it'll get better.
It will get better when I'm entirely completely dead.
I wish it didn't hurt people but I shouldn't want to live just to avoid hurting others. That's not a life.
And why do people who barely spend time with me act like losing me will be such a shock. Like we already barely talk. Just continue your life exactly as is. Stupid emotions. 
With every year and every time I try to fight harder, I regret it all and wish I did it earlier.
More time just makes it worse, nothing is getting better.
I'm becoming more and more pessimistic. I give up more and more and it hurts more and more.
I can probably do it all. I want none of it.
I just wish one day I'll have the strength to do it. To finally stop annoying people with long useless rants. Be true to my word and do it."|1
hi, I'm 13, I'm Italian and I need help. (sorry if my english sucks, i'm using google translate). I've been suffering from depression for almost a year, my parents say it's just a phase, even though the doctors or something diagnosed me with it. I would love to get out of it, and for this I have to take some medicines, but my parents say I can't, because they would drive me crazy. I know they won't. I have planned my suicide for September 5th 2021, if I don't start a proper treatment, I will die that day. I just wanted to ask you, people of reddit, how can I convince my parents? how can I? please, I don't want to die, I'm so afraid of death, I'm just a kid...|1
I'm usually pretty happy, but lately I feel like a failure. I just went on Facebook and saw one of my classmates from a community college I graduated from a few years ago had already finished their first year of teaching this year. I just earned my bachelor's in studio art which is a degree that's always being crapped on, and have yet to begin the student teaching program at the University I go to. I will be 26 this year, I went straight from highschool to college and have been in the same job for the whole time I've been completing my higher education. I feel burnt out and like I haven't done enough with my life or like my achievements just don't add up to everyone else's. I even sold an art piece and will be featured in a magazine but I just feel lost and like I'm not enough. I have a great support system but I'm still feeling this way. I'm in a semi-constant state of being sad like my life is already over and I didn't do enough.|1
"I seriously fall further and further with nothing good in sight. My effort rarely pays off, and the few times that it does is always an instant gratification before it subsides.

I want something lasting, but it feels impossible to grasp. I hardly enjoy anything anymore. The only thing that saves me is BOTW right now, I don't enjoy video games normally, but that game is seriously an escape. whenever it's done, I really don't know what I'm going to do.

I'm living to escape, and it's impossible to get my feet in the ground when nothing in the real world is worth striving to achieve. It's such a damn mess, I really don't want anything at all. Other than maybe a relationship, but I have no experience with that, and am I even ready for it? It's a fucking nightmare to exist when everything is confusing and feels pointless.

There's really no reason to go on whatsoever other than to make sure I don't hurt other people, and that's fucking miserable to me. I've searched and searched to no avail, I'm about to be 24 and no closer to my goals than 18. I've tried a job and just can't even function long enough without suicidal thoughts flooding my brain or becoming so irritated with coworkers that I burst.

Feel like I'm at wits end, I've tried therapy, everything. I'm mainly just venting. I want to get better, but I won't."|1
Basically just what the title says. I’ve recently moved to a new a city for a job where I don’t know anyone and I think I’m going through a major depressive episode. There’s a lot of stuff at play that I’d rather not get into on here but I guess I was just wondering what people’s experiences are with that. I’m still on my parents health insurance plan as well and I know they’d pay for it if I asked but I’d rather not tell them what I’m going through cause I know they let worry. Any feedback would be great though.|1
"hello, this is the first time i’m making a post on reddit, and it’s because i really because i don’t know what to do / who to ask any more. it’s going to be really long but if you’re willing to read through this and give me advice, thank you so so much in advance.

some backstory: my friend and i are both 17. we entered a new school january last year and are in the same class. we became close because she’s friends with some of my friends, and we’re in a friendgroup of about 5 people. she’s one of the most empathetic and lovely people i know - introverted, loves yellow, beautiful skies, good literature and shitty humor. 

as far as i know she’s being struggling w anxiety and depression even before she was 13. at the start of last year she seemed alright, and things weren’t too bad, but then things slowly got worse. there isn’t always a reason, but i’m certain that the increasing academic pressure (+ pandemic robbing us of opportunities to do things that could’ve cheered her up) is one of the reasons. she got sent to a psych hospital towards the end of last year, but got out in time to join us for the new school year. 

she either got sent back / admitted herself again this february and hasn’t been out since. the one time they tried to discharge her she went back the very same day. at the start i did my best to check in on her, text her whenever she posted something concerning (she has access to her phone), send her things that might cheer her up. and i’m not the most mentally stable person ever so i cried quite a bit - combination of fear, helplessness, constant worry... i felt like i was experiencing anticipatory grief. but as the days passed i began to get busier, and i still worried about her often but i haven’t been contacting her as much.

here comes the first part where i need advice. she’s always been so strong and such a god damn fighter, and she’s always wanted to get better, to live, etc, but today she posted something along the lines of “i don’t know how much longer i have to live, and if i have to leave this year know that i do so with love”, and i’m so scared that she’ll really leave this time. 

i don’t know what to tell her. i know nothing i say can make it better any more, but i don’t want to say nothing. i know i should tell her something about how she still has so much ahead of her, something encouraging, but she’s been through so fucking much and it looks like it hurts so badly that even i can see why she wants to leave. but i’m terrified that if i say anything else it’ll sound as if i’m... for the lack of a better phrase, ready for her to die. it’s been a while since i’ve texted her too. i want to tell her i love her, that she’ll always be a wonderful friend and person in my eyes, that i wish we could have made more memories together, but i don’t know how to say it without it having some kind of negative connotation

there’s something else that i need advice with for. i don’t know what to feel at all. to tell the truth, her being sent to the psych hospital gave me a bit of relief, because before this i was constantly on edge and looking out for her, but we’re both stupid fucking kids and i didn’t know how much i could help her without breaking myself. at least i know she’s getting some professional help at the hospital. after i got over my few months of constant worrying, i became a lot happier, but there was always this feeling that i SHOULD be constantly worried, should be finding ways to make things better. and admittedly i didn’t text her or cheer her up as much as i could because i wanted to not worry. i wanted to enjoy my own life, which was selfish. i don’t know what to feel now. i know i can’t do anything about it because she’s already getting help, but i don’t know if she’s really going to leave this time. and it’s been so long since i’ve seen her that i’m almost terrified that i’ve lost my sense of care and concern for her. even as i’m typing this i wonder if i do it out of a sense of obligation. i’m scared that i won’t feel anything if something happens, or that i’ll force myself to not feel anything.

that’s kind of it. it’s really late and i didn’t proofread any of this so if you made it through this incoherent mess, thank you so much. i hope that someone will be able to tell me what i should say and feel. 

please stay safe, wear a mask and stay healthy, i hope you’re doing well yourselves."|1
I'm the fucking manager, I can't have breakdowns at work!!!!! I was so embarrassed afterwards. I know, I know, at least I have a job, but damn, I have no idea what snapped in my brain to decide crying and hyperventilating was the better choice than just DOING MY JOB.|1
I used to be full with life, like I was doing crazy stuff. I was going out with my friends, generally having fun. But now I don't enjoy anything. It feels like the same everyday. I can't find MY meaning of life. I can't express my feelings either. I seem all good outside to my friends my family but I scream only in the inside that I am bad. I only laugh around my friends now but nowhere else. I just wanna leave this earth as soon as possible(not suicidal because the Kuran says that Allah can only take the life he gave and if you do it he will not be forgiving). If I was going to get killed the second I walk out of my house, I would not be sad. Thanks for reading|1
I have dealing with depression for 6 years now. And today is a hard one. I received terrible news and having trouble dealing with it. Thinking negative thoughts and dangerous moods. Someone to talk to would be great.|1
 I personally believe in true freedom. I rather see people be free than be slaves to money and god but then they'll make another. To me death is the ultimate freedom because then you don't have a control group around. You can do whatever you want without anyone saying anything.|1
"Hi, I think this is my first time posting here.

I've got bipolar I and am rapid cycling a lot. My moods range and it can go from really happy and productive to  depressed to the point, a few days ago, that I had to remove some stuff from my home for my safety. I asked my aunt (who I don't really know well) to take it for me. I guess that was my way of asking for help without saying the words. I'm afraid of those words. I always thought you deal with mental health stuff by yourself , so it never occurred to me to ask. Who in the family do I tell? Is it something I can keep between my aunt and me? I honestly don't know how this works. My mind is so messed up and foggy and I don't want them to think of me as weak or someone to be pitied. 

I'm also going to ask my therapist how to do it on Tuesday. I need help, I need to hear that everything is going to be ok and this disassociate fog won't last forever. I need to know I'm not alone in this. I can't find my way out of this by myself. 

Thanks for reading."|1
i just need one person to comment please. my parents are making me go on a road trip on june 10th and it is like 9 days long. this will trigger my anxiety and depression but i will have no way to cope. i know i’m going to freak out but i can’t tell anybody and i don’t know how i will deal with it. it’s like i will be trapped in my head and i can’t cope how i usually do. this is one of my biggest fears so i decided that i would rather go to a mental hospital. that also terrifies the fuck out of me but i do need help from there anyway because i’m suicidal everyday. i don’t know how to get into one though, do i tell my therapist or call 911 or a hotline? please let me know, if i have to go on the trip i will probably try to kill myself. i already asked my friend for advice but he got kinda annoyed it felt like, so please help. ;/|1
When you get out of the hospital, you go home, take it easy and try to feel better. Not in my case. Homeless and after 3 days in the hospital because of my pancreas, I'm trying to find work to survive and keep me going fir a few more days. I live in Canada and don't use or drink because of this I avoid the shelters and sleep outside. When I was a kid, this isn't what I wanted to be.|1
"I used to dissociate, pretty much any time uncomfortable feelings were involved. I’ve gotten so much better to the point where I don’t even know when the last time I dissociated was.

The problem now is, what in the world do I do with all of these awful feelings? I used to be able to go about my day no matter what horrible thing was going on in my life, now that “skill” has been lost. 

I miss dissociating, even though I know I’m mentally healthier without it. Has anyone else felt this? And do you have any idea what I can do?"|1
I’m disabled, Im obese, Im the youngest in my family which means if something obesity related doesn’t kill me I will have to drag myself through life for 50 more years and watch everyone I love die. Dying from an early heart attack sounds better than that but I got a doctorate degree and havent found meaningful work and I don’t care to put in the effort I am so burnt out but what is the point of coming this far then dying? I don’t get to enjoy any of my life and there’s no happily ever after in sight. I don’t want to die young but I don’t want to be old and alone with no purpose. At least if I die I could finally rest and not worry.|1

"I am not even sure i have depression, but i don't feel human i can't stand the idea of going outside my room (i live in a foreign country far from my family).

Today my sister told me she never wants to speak to me again because i told her i was alone for 7 months and i feel like i have no ambition.

I keep thinking of a bridge near my school with waterfalls as the only way to feel like i exist. I feel so ashamed. I feel so ashamed and im not surprised by how slowly, people i still talk to will realize i am truly a waste"|1
"ive been thinking of telling my parents just a little bit but i wanna hear ab other peoples stories (even if people mostly have good experiences i probably wont tell my parents but im still curious)

&#x200B;

edit: i just wanted to add that a few months ago i was close to telling my family about it. i went to the doctors office a few months ago for a check up with my mom and twin sister (we go to the same check up). there was this mental health sheet that we had to fill out and i answered kind of truthfully though for some things i marked it down to make it seem less serious (for example when it said if i thought about killing myself i put it as rarely but it was much more than that it was everyday).

i regretted that survey so bad. in front of me, my sister, and my mom, the doctor just started calmly talking about it and was like ""so it looks like shes been feeling down and she should see a therapist."" my face went so red i honestly dont know what i expected from that sheet but i did not expect her to say that in front of all of us together. it was so embarrassing and she pulled my mom out to talk about it.

after that i felt so ashamed and i was really quiet. i dont know how to explain it but the look on my moms face just scared me so much it made me feel like i just did something wrong or i put a burden on her (im sure she didnt intend for it to come off that way though)

so i lied and said it was just the stress from school and it would go away soon. i couldve said something and went to the therapist the doctor recommended but i just couldnt get over that shame i felt. sometimes i want to try talking to my mom about it again but its so scary

also it kind of made me sad cus recently i found out that somehow my brother and dad found out too. like i kind of get my dad knowing since my mom would have to talk to him about it but someone told my brother and it just feels weird knowing my family was talking about it behind my back"|1
for the past 1-2 years I've felt depressed, I'm 14 my family is religious Jewish and I don't agree with that and that's most of why I'm depressed, I personally don't believe in a God but whenever I think about saying that to my family I just start thinking about how everyone will hate me and be disappointed anyone know how to talk to family about this subject|1
Tbh I don’t know where to start with this or if anyone gives two fucks but here I go anyway, I’ve always felt different even as a kid, Ik it sounds cliche but as a kid I’d be on my own a lot and I’d use my imagination as an escape, for some reason I think I came up the idea that the Best emotional state is discomfort. I’d think of people as reflections of my own psyche  weather that was friends or family, so I’d mostly be in a dark room playing video games all hours of the day and night. As I got older 12-13 I found marijuana and that became a new escape for me. By this age my parents had been divorced maybe for 6 years or so, i was always closet to my dad as I believe my mum had some narcissistic tendencies, everything was always on me but that’s besides the point. About 14-15 my dad had to have his leg off because of a blood clot and I believe this effect my life a lot, he eventually got put in a complex for disabled people, I’d come here on the weekends to stay here and found some of his medication “ morphine” I’d take that some days, I was even huffing deodorant from time to time but then everything changed when I met my ex girlfriend I’d never had someone show me love the way she did but obviously my damaged self took advantage out of her, it lasted nearly 4 years until she had enough of my shit. We kept in contact for a while but you know how that shit goes, I turned to clubbing after that I used to get so drunk and high of God knows what to the point where I’d black out and do ridiculous shit. I think something  happened between these blackouts and probably traumatised me to The point where my brain doesn’t want to  eventually Covid hit, I was kicked out of my home By my mother at this serious time, she sold the house and I had to go care for my dad, i’ve been doing this for a year by myself. It gets harder and harder each day seeingn him get worse to. We are getting help finally i’m also getting help from my mental health. They recently put me on Zoloft, but I’ve been Taking other meds too as I’m surrounded by them. I’ve done Coke a few times On my fare Share of psychedelics Please made me realise what an awful person I am, I keep thinking my ex is just gonna show up and it’s been two years. I just don’t know if I can carry on like this. But I’m trying to get help. If anyone actually read this I appreciate it.|1
I started seeing a new therapist for the first time after a while again in January. It’s a somewhat stereotypical “how does that make you feel?” kind of therapy, which, for the first few weeks, having been through CBT and more “active” types of problem solving made me annoyed. I kept feeling like it wasn’t working and wouldn’t get me anywhere. But it turns out I’ve been trying to fix everything I’ve repressed instead of letting it exist first, and tonight every single trauma came to me in this flood and I realized, I was angry. Really, truly, pissed for the first time in my life. I’m pissed I had to go through all of this in my life. I’m pissed I feel like I’m never living. I’m pissed that I feel like so much of my life has been wasted. I’m pissed at everyone who left or took advantage when I was at my worst. I’m pissed at myself, for all the times I was jealous, or co-dependent, or messed up. I’m angry being anxious and depressed has been overwhelming for YEARS. I haven’t felt so much in so long and I don’t really know where to go from here. What do you do with everything you’ve held onto?|1
"I've been dating my boyfriend for more than a year now.
When we met, he started spiraling into a black hole of depression. He also works quite a stressful job, and upon that, covid hit and we got stuck far away from eachoter, each of us in a different European country.


However, since then, he has been worse and worse.
He is a truly great guy and it makes me beyond sad to see what depression made out of him.
He is talking with me every single day, however there are worse days, and better days.
This week has been especially hard because he spiraled into his manic phase, in which he becomes completely irrational and impossible to talk to.
He starts imagining some distant futures for us, saying that it will never happen because of his state.
He also panics and starts telling me how he cannot be with me and that I should better let him go. That he needs to be alone and that I deserve much better.
He stresses constantly because he cannot give me his 100%. He stresses because he cannot be ""the guy which I deserve"".
He stresses over things which are just in his head, and nowhere else - because he knows that I do not expect anything of him.


I truly wish that he gets better, and after that we could talk about relationships and distant futures, and what not. I am not pushing him, nor doing anything to make his state worse. I have told him numerous and numerous times that I have no expectations from him and that the most important thing is that he gets better because of HIMSELF, and then because of everything else.
99% of the time our communication is great, and we never argue or have any issues. 
However, that 1% are his manic phases (which are rare, but still here), when he starts projecting distant futures and things which he thinks will or will not happen.
And because there is no filters or any rational thinking in those moments, I get hurt a lot.



Personally I am not depressed, but I have been for some periods of my life, when I was a teenager. However, I cannot really fully understand what it's like.
I researched a lot, and talked with him a lot.
I wish I could get some advice or a tip for how to help him feel better, or how not to make his manic phases even worse?

What to do when he starts spiraling into conversations which are completely irrational? 

What to say to encourage him, or how to approach him without sounding condescending or what not?



I have come to the point where I feel hopeless.
I feel broken, because I see what depression has done to him.
I feel beyond sad because I wish with all my heart that he gets better. I am crying a lot, because I wish I could help him and remove his pain.
He is taking medications, but it seems that it's not working. I have suggested him that he should try a different one, but it triggers him to talk about it.
I feel broken, because of him. Because he is such a beautiful and gentle soul, and it hurts me to see him like this. 

I don't know what to do or how to approach this.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."|1
"Nothing is going on good in my life literally nothing I've got no one everybody i love or care about seems depressed. I don't enjoy anything, I've got no energy and cosntent headache, my family seems sad the whole time although we don't really have problems....... 
And the thing that hurts me the most my little brother (7 yrs old) seems sad the whole time sad .......
 I tried everything with him but nothing is working.

If there is a god plz give break plz let me sleep for at least two month and........ I don't even have the energy to write anymore"|1
Every night I fear the next day I wish the night never ended. I hate being fucked up.|1
I’ve been afforded every possible privilege in life. I had a great home life, I’m financially stable, I’m getting an education, I even met new (i hope) friends. I have absolutely no reason to feel this way but I do. I just got done crying about nothing in particular, just laying on my couch lamenting my existence and thinking about how I don’t want to be here. I recently was presented with a great career opportunity in my field and I took it, which I thought would make me happy but it just made me more stressed out. I’m going to school for a subject I don’t even know if I like all that much, but I’m good at school so I figure I’ll just stick it out until its done. I feel super pathetic even sitting here and writing this post, but I’m too scared to tell anyone I know or to reach out to a professional. I’m not really sure what I expect to get from writing this either. The other day I was at school and I noticed scattered around the halls there were messages of encouragement for people with depression. Things like “people care about you” or “your struggle is an important part in the story of life”. That second one really rubbed me the wrong way. Why should I have to struggle? Why should anyone? This sadness I have doesn’t make me stronger, it beats me down until I feel like I can’t stand up. I’m glad that theres an effort to reach those struggling, and I hope they genuinely did make someone feel better, but to me these messages felt very manufactured and fake. The people that wrote them have no idea who I am or what I’m dealing with. They just felt fakey and felt to me more like “hey don’t do it yet we haven’t exhausted you for all you’re worth”. I don’t know. I just don’t know what to do. Thanks for reading my stream of consciousness.|1
"I keep wanting to convulse, tense up, jerk/shake about (almost like I’m trying to wake up) and scream as loud as I can right now—but I don’t quite know why. Started happening after getting triggered again by back-to-back-to-back movies (all different from each other) where sex appeal, relationships, having one’s act somewhat together, attention, talents, skills, attractiveness, desirability, interests. I feel so broken, alien and alone. Animal. 

I’ve had my abdominal convulsions or contractions (my guess is from a result of romantic and other complex trauma) for years now, but never been like this before, with the jerking of my neck, head and upper body. 

Distant."|1
Everyone keeps telling me to not stress out and to not be depressed, but they don’t understand that I don’t know what it is ! I don’t know how to fix it. Any help ?|1
"Basically, I used to be very active, hard-working, enthusiastic in trying new things, Love art, creative work, Fun going person. 

I used to have a group of people around me all the time. Used to make friends really quick, give strong suggestions, support who needed. People used to like me immediately, I used to feel happy that all who like me, talking to me. (Positive about all)

\---------------------

Now slowly I became a different person.  

\- Lazy, Became more Introvert

\- Always having fear, tension 

\- doubts and trust issues with people, 

\- fear to talk to new people, 

\- Thinking what others are thinking about me (negative thoughts), 

\- Not getting want I wanted very badly, 

\- cannot ask for help, Tried many times to ask for help, Don't know something stops me - Thinking whom to ask (End up having none to reach out to).

\- Staying alone all-time in my room, away from family

\- In a new place with no good friends with whom I can share all (Moved away from family two years back. Since then slowly things started getting bad).

\- Don't feel like cooking/eating

\- Think a lot about the future and have tension for no reason. 

\- I wanted to get my desired job, Trying for so long (Luck never favors me), I feel sorry for myself when others who don't have minimum technical knowledge, That I do have also getting better jobs than me (I never took anyone help, never cheated, I did all on my own, which is lacking from others). Now after trying so long, Feels like run away from this because every time falling - I got tired of it. 

\-  Days are going and going - Feels I'm not doing anything productive, Which making me sad. 

\- I took a break and started watching a lot of movies and series. But ended up doing only that whole month and addicted. This wants I don't want to do anymore since it's making me run away from my reality. 

\- Now I don't feel like doing anything in my life. 

\- I'm grateful for want I have, I'm doing a small job which I also like (But feels I wanted a better one very badly), I don't have any other problems, no responsibilities, no relationship problems because I'm asexual, all good. But I'm not happy.  Why?

I-  Tired of questioning myself a lot.  My heart feels like if I get a job that I wanted and move somewhere I would feel good and become better. 

\- But things are not going as I wanted. This I can't control. 

\---------------------------

This is more like writing for myself for seeking help. But I'm also open to suggestions from you people. 

let me know if anyone faced the same issues as me and what makes you feel happy in this kinda situation."|1
Lately I’ve been depressed I can’t bear to tell my family because I don’t like being comforted because it was used against me and for reasons I won’t explain how was used against me I came here to get comfort from random strangers instead of my family because I can’t get comfort from them anymore I love my family but I can’t get comfort from them if you can please comfort me|1
"Well, that. I reached out to a group of friends. I’ve hit a new low, I’m having a really bad meltdown for the second timey this week and so I reached out to friends and for the second time this week they ignored me and then changed the subject.

Very few things in life have hurt more than that."|1
"I’ve recently been prescribed Prozac for my depression and OCD, I’ve been on it about 8 weeks, and for the first 6-7 I felt like I had legitimately lost my mind.  My anxiety was worse than it’s ever been, I was having suicidal thoughts, and my OCD was getting almost unmanageable. I know it Mexican can play tricks for the first little bit, especially when going off one and switching to another.  But for others who have been prescribed Prozac, how long until you felt “normal” or “evened out”?
I have a follow up apt with my doc next week, I’m just wondering about others experiences."|1
"Tl;dr: I'm lonely. Can't open up to people. Just end me. 



Like it's not that bad... Like I got good friends I think.

I got a paranoid personality disorder and have fucking thoughts about every single person in my life actually don't want me, or hate me - or have an evil intention against. Me..
I get so lonely. The disorder just pulls me away from people and making me distant, can't open up and tell them Im lonely af and need a friend. I

Just... Just
Like I fucking wish I could  explain it to them, but I just know that days after that I start getting thoughts and feeling bout them fucking using the information as an advantage over me. 
WHY. 
Like does my thoughts just go the whole way to the negative shit, the bad shit. I actually just want to AAAARGH. 
Like. The dilemma man I want to get closer to my friends, but I'm afraid to ask shit. 
Today I asked If I could come over next month 
And 1 said you are always welcome 
AND I TOOK AS THEY DON'T ACTUALLY MEAN LIEUV8URHFRBDUF
can I say it? No, can I ask about it. No. 
Can I fucking share my thoughts and feelings with them? No. I'm too closed to gain any great connection. 
I can only be funny, helpful or annoying. 
Not to mention that my friend! One friend that sometimes checks up on me lives far away. 
And I have no friends in my area. 
my friend invites her to her party's with people from my old school that I can talk to. 
But they never text, hey yo how's it going or some shit. 

Well I mean ofc, it goes both ways. And I don't blame them - and also I Fucking WISH I HAD THE BRAVERY TO CHECK UP ON PEOPLE. God fucking damn it. 

Like I wanna get closer to them but I just don't know how. 

I can have fun with them and stuff and talk with them easily when we're at the party warty but I just can't be able to get close enough to people that they wanna hang out with me man like, without the alcohol and partying like fucking go to the beach, movies or like chill at home or some like FUCKING WHAT 
Im just closed and mysterious. People don't really know me that well, CAUSE I DON'T SHARE WITHOUT GETTING WORRIED AND GETTING PROBLEMS LATER ON
Yea. man Ive been crying myself to sleep the last 7 days I just.. 



I just don't wanna be in this shit anymore.
JUST FUCKING STOP THINKING EVERYONE HAS BAD INTENTION AGAINST YOU. JUST. FUCKING STOP YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT.



Just end me. Man. Just. Fucking. End me.
Thanks for letting me share...
The only place I don't get all weird about to share cause y'all don't know me."|1
"My mom and I just had a huge fight. She can't accept that my feelings have been hurt over the 18 years of my life by the things she has deemed right.
The fight got out of hand and when she mentioned that she deserves respect as my mother I told her that I never asked to be here (as in alive) and she said, ""Nobody's holding you here.""

Now I'm in my room, I'm tired because our fights are all the same and I just want to die."|1
I'm at the point where I'm genuinely, unironically starting to believe that there's some sort of spirit or god or outside power that is fucking with me and trying to make me feel like shit, maybe for character development or something. The shitty things that keep happening to me are almost comedic and so unstatistical that someone or something must be doing this on purpose.|1
"I will either be soon homeless for a very long time, in a mental hospital, or maybe group home. All are terrible options, and i might go blind as well.

So why keep going? I mean homelessness seems to be the least worst option of this but stilll bad.  I will never be able to live an independent and fullfilling life."|1
"This happens every time I try to sleep...
I wake up in my head in a room only brightened by a static tv.. there’s someone sitting beside me but I don’t know who they are... all I see is there eyes.. there cold dead faded blue eyes.... but when I realize that I’m in my head the tv and the person disappear... and all I see is my dead father disappointingly shaking his head mouthing the words “stop being in a paradox”... but then i tell him “I know you are fake”... after that I end up in a pitch black room with no light, exit, window or anything.. except for a distant dripping sound... if I close my eyes in the room my body spirals and I wake up on the floor feeling empty and dead.... 

Even though I’m scared of my head I at least am calling out for any kind of help...
Or I may fall into oblivion knowing that I at least attempted to find help...."|1
"  well,to start with,i have to announce that i'm a Chinese 17 boy who have been dealing with a serious depression half a year.if u don't mind,as a junior high student(now i'm taking a break at home),so my English is not so well. why i come here for help?because i don't wanna spread negative moods to my friends anymore,i don't wanna make them think that i'm so disturbing.
  they say that i'm a intelligent person,but i just think i'm born sensitive.i think i totally figured this fricking world out,or i just assume too much.but one thing i can tell is that i'm a tortured soul.every minute is so painful,i don't have any hope for future,i can't feel any  joy.
  the only reason why i haven't killed myself is i don't wanna make my family members and friends sad.
they are so caring."|1
"Well, thanks for invalidating the fact that something’s wrong with me.

The struggles of living in an African American household are real and I wish parents like mine understood our mental health. I’ve had depression since I was 8 and have been hiding it because I didn’t want my parents to know and start yelling at me.

I’ve always felt the need to never share my deepest secrets with my parents because they’d either never understand or just think I’m weird."|1
"I feel like there's much more to me but it all only comes down to how well I can do things. How about those little things about me, my personality, my hobbies and just things that make me into me. Will anyone really like me for who I am? :"")"|1
"I was raised by 2 alcoholics who beat the shit out of me & my sister. My fucking anxiety makes it to the point where I can't leave me house half the time & now that everyone seems to wanna kill each other over bullshit like masks, skin color & political views....I just don't care anymore. I want this place to burn. I'm tired of being alone. I'm tired of nobody listening. I'm tired of hardly getting by. I'm tired of girls thinking I just want to fuck. I'm tired of having to take meds to feel ""normal"" that don't work. I'm tired of being so anxious I don't eat. I'm tired of being awkward. I'm tired of small gestures making me overwhelmed. *I'm fucking tired.*   


My motivation to be apart of society is completely gone & I'm ok with that now because now I realize I was unwanted to begin with."|1
Why does it feel like death is the only sure way to end depression...I mean....nothing else helps anyways...I've not slept without taking a pill for the past 2 weeks now...I've lost a lot of weight thinking...I just feel like death is the only sure thing for me right now... It's probably gonna happen sooner...I hope I have the strength to see it through.. !!|1
"I’ve tried all methods , online, in person, group etc. I can’t connect with them, it’s almost like I can see the overused “advice” they give me. “Put yourself put there” “all people aren’t like that” and any form response you can think of.

I’ve never been a likable person, no lasting friendships, no serious relationship, and I just have to much wrong with me for people to care.

I’m not the fun life of the party or the smart one. I’m the one people ask .. why did you bring that person. 

People are selfish and they will only befriend me if I’m of value to them and I’m just not valued. My therapist wants me to put myself out there to be reminded of this? 

People will give advice saying someone will love you but no one wants to be that someone. You know what happens when everyone pass the task to someone else ? It never gets done. 

For once it would be nice for someone to say I’ll stick by you and mean it. I’m not going anywhere and mean it. Not promise me someone else will come along because life doesn’t work that way. 

Even my therapist is passing my healing off to these fictional people that are supposed to love me if only I put myself out there."|1
"I’ve had a rough week and woke up feeling shitty. Today is day 1 being sober from alcohol after a bad relapse. I have to go work for 11 hours and don’t want to. I called off yesterday because of car issues so calling off again isn’t an option.

I just wanna crawl back in bed and cry."|1
"Had an absolute shit week at work getting cussed out by horrible people, had a break down got yelled at by a coworker telling me I needed to ""calm down"" because it was unprofessional. But w/e it's the weekend can't let the big depressi demon get me down so I push through the sad to go do some very much needed yard work done. 20  mins in a group of teenagers roll by on their parents golf cart and scream ""your house looks like shit!"" Followed by what I can only describe as the ""retard sign"" then speeding away laughing. 

My day is officially over at 9 in the morning and am currently crying over a bowl of Mac n cheese. Happy memorial day everyone....."|1
i’ve never had friends. i’ve had a few people who were my close friends but they always leave. my best friend of 4 years just changed her mind about me. what is it that is so terrible about me that no one wants to hang out with me|1
I’m 14 and i always drag out taking a shower. When there’s a reason to take one like going to get my haircut or going to school i take one with no issue. But when i’m at home during the weekend i just wait till the last minute.|1
"Trauma hasn’t made me stronger. It’s made me so fucking unstable that even little things fucking destroy me and make me have a breakdown. I’m so fucking pathetic it’s not even funny

Didn’t even go through serious trauma and yet I can barely function

I’m just so fucking exhausted. I’m genuinely so close to ending my life lmao"|1
Recently found it harder to avoid thoughts about dying or being hurt. This sucks because I have been doing well externally. I don't want to go back to self loathing and attempting. It's just hard to because of how much hate I see.|1
"I've been on a downwards slope for quite a while, but only recently has my brain begun to fail me.

I'm scared and anxious about what's going to happen to me, because I can't even remember if I took my medicine in the morning or in the evening. My language skills are failing me.

It's going to be one of those nights where I cry myself to sleep, isn't it."|1
"I recently got my test results and they were horrible, absolutely horrible, I locked up my room and cried for a solid half an hour, it isn't just the grades that led me to it.
Everything rushed into my head at that time, how stupid I was, how smart other people were, how horrible life is, how lonely I was, I just needed someone to to hug at that time, if I had a gun or any instant death causing items, I would've used it at that moment.
Again, its not the grades that led me to it, I'm 19,a college fresher, the only significant thing I've done in my entire life was to get in to this college, we have this big ass entrance examination to get in, and I'd spent three years of my life to get in, but I didn't get in the way I wanted to, I didn't exactly ""crack"" the exam, I'd messed it up, this was my second year writing the exam and the realization that I'd messed up even on the second try is something that I'll take to my grave. There were some people I'd competed with, some juniors, not a day goes by in which I don't think about how dumb I am compared to them, not a day goes by during which I don't think that I've failed at every thing I've ever tried in life, and it's true, I don't recall a single instance in which I was able to prove myself that I'd won at something, that I'd succeeded, I've failed at every single thing I've tried to pursue, I don't have any friends or family that I'm close with, I don't need them either, but all I care about is whether I perceive myself to be better or not, but I've never done that, I'm still the dumb kid I was ten years ago, I don't know what I'm going to do, I'm stuck with a physics degree I can't even fuck off from academia and just go out and take a job, I'll have to get a masters to even get a wage, most importantly I need to get out of my country, this is the most important requirement, I desperately want to reform my sisters life just a little and then immediately get out and cut contact with everyone else, I then aspire to buy a little cabin and kill myself when I'm bored.
But the problem is that the desire to kill myself is starting to kick in already, I don't know what I'm going to do anymore, I've fucked up so bad that I can't focus on any other choice, 
Because I swear to god, (if that fatass even exists) that I'll kill myself if I'm not able to get out of this country by the time I get a degree, because that would mean my life's end.
Its not just grades... 
Girls think I'm a creep, people think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb, I see people who get whatever they want went they work hard or even if they dont, I see people who are cheered on by the people around them to work hard, everyone supporting them to succeed, while I sit in my shit hole daydreaming about fancy futures and what not, I'm a fucking useless idiot."|1
anyone thats can or just wants to just comment i literally dont mind talking about anything|1
"TLDR at end
So about a year ago I told my mom that I was feeling depressed, I regretted that choice more than any other of my entire fucking life, don’t get me wrong she was super understanding, nice, and didn’t do anything by wrong, but I ended up with a therapist, who was *also* amazing, thing is I fucking hate therapists. I managed to convince her and my dad that I got better, literally just so I could stop seeing the therapist. I have since gotten hundreds of times worse, and want nothing more than to tell a parent, I’m much more comfortable talking to my mom about stuff like this than my dad, but if I tell her and not my dad, I feel like he’ll think I don’t trust him or something, and AAaAaaäEeEĘeeÆ fuck what do I do. TLDR, I fell more comfortable talking to my mom than my dad, but I don’t want to make my dad think I don’t trust him. How do I tell them I’m depressed."|1
"Hello everyone,

For as long as I can remember (heh) I had a pretty bad memory and only few years back got diagnosed with depression. Now taking Vortioxetine helped my overall mood, but sadly had no effect on memory so my quest for answers and getting better continues... I've read dozens of memory-related threads in this subreddit (also in brainfog, ADHD, nosurf, neuro communities) and problems people describe here match my own very well, but I didn't see many talking about improvement with an exception of more episodic memory loss.

So, I guess what I'm looking for is a little bit of hope. Did anyone manage to improve their memory? 

Either way, I wish you a pleasant day!"|1
"my family, especially my parents, think they understand how i feel but fail to understand that its more than just being sad, and that because im on medication ill be ""cured""

she refuses to accept that ill struggle with this for a long time, maybe my whole life idk, and sometimes she refuses to accept theres anything wrong with me at all"|1
"I know what I need to do to at least have slightly better days. Get up earlier, exercise, respond to friends, take small steps to do things I enjoy or get important tasks done each day. I always say, ""Tomorrow will be a better day."" 

But when I wake up in the morning I feel nothing and I just don't even care to help myself. But I know that if I do nothing I will never get better. And the cycle repeats.

Any advice to snap out of feeling like I can't even move due to depression, if even for a few hours?"|1
"My mom doesn't even notice my behavior or see that I'm depressed. I do a good job at hiding it but still? I can't hide thst all I do is stay in bed staring at my phone and have gained 30 pounds? I can't even talk to her anyways because she never listens to me. She rather do whatever she is doing on her phone and ignore me and just say ""uh huh"" and fake that she is listening. I hate it. It's my pet peeve. I hate talking to someome and they rather just say uh huh while staring at their phone. If makes me feel even worse. More fn worthless. 
When she does that I just stop talking and go on about life and she doesn't care. I'll be like whatever and you wonder why I don't talk to you about anything. I never feel like what I have to say is important. Ever. I'm just a nobody"|1
"This is a general call to many of the people who post here. I see a lot of pain, and it hurts me to see others like this

Life is unfair. What you are feeling, you do not deserve. 

The universe does not care. It has no means. But you can.

Be kind to humans, including yourself. Some are having a rough day. 

we humans are our only hope. Reach out for a hand up or reach out to be a hand up

I’ve been wanting to tell my therapist how my mom gets drunk constantly and I’m responsible for taking care of her, but I’m not sure if that will make the therapist call a social worker or not. Will my mom get in trouble if I say that?|1
"Kinda curious, are there people who are consistently depressed but do not regularly think about suicide? 

I feel like for me there have maybe been weeks at a time after something happened where I wanted to live and did not want to commit suicide as a solution, but generally for my entire adult life it feels like suicide has always been at the back of my mind as a viable solution for escaping suffering. 

So just interested to see if other people on the sub think this way. Honestly its kind of hard for me to imagine what its like to live at all without wanting to kill yourself, but its especially difficult for me to understand what it would be like to be depressed and not idealize suicide, like what do you even think in that situation?"|1
"it's been 4 years and I'm still waiting for things to get better. I don't know why or how I started feeling like this, it's like 1 morning I woke up and it just hit me ""Living is fucking stupid"" and at that moment I just dropped everything, my goals, my grades, my dreams, relationships, my way of living, I just gave up on trying. 2 years later (final year of high school) i tried picking everything up, hoping to fix the way I feel and recover what id lost, but nothing changed, so I just dropped it all again.

I always see people on here actually having a reason for being depressed and I feel like I'm just spitting on their face because nothing traumatizing has ever happened to me (other than an abusive dad and some other shit, but that doesn't count, I think). I'm sorry you all had to go through that and I really do hope things get better for you, and I'm really fucking sorry for feeling like this when you've been through so much. If I could trade my Life with yours so you could live a somewhat better life away from the problems you're facing, I would do so in a heartbeat. But yeah.

Its just, living is something I dont want to do anymore. Peace ✌

I don't mean ""Peace ✌"" as I'm going to off myself. I just thought it would look cool at the end of what I was saying, so ahh, Peace ✌ again"|1
I read someone post something similar and it got me thinking . I’m pretty toxic and I don’t want to change. I just wish I could end things. No one should have to deal with me nor should I have to suffer alone. I’ll never have a close friend or a true love, I’m too damaged for those things . No one should have to put up with me.., I just don’t want to have to watch while all the normal people get to have a happy ending while I have to sit in this prison of me|1

"I dont actually know anymore. I dont know what I want anymore. I feel like I'm screaming in my own head and I dont even know what about. I have a bottomless black hole inside where my soul is supposed to be. I feel like I have a gnawing emptiness and every time i get distracted from that for long enough to have any kind of happy emotion for more than 10 mins i suddenly start missing it. I miss the empty. I suddenly start feeling like a fake. A fake for being happy/acting happy, even if it was just pretend to appease other people. A fake for being sad because hey look I can be happy,, I'm not depressed I'm just making it up duhhh. What the fuck is wrong with me. Do I even want to be happy anymore?

my depression is literally ruining my life, i ruined my favourite friendship because of it and i can’t live with that fact, i fucking hate myself for it so much. i had to drop out of college too because my depression made me physically unable to get out of bed. things keep getting worse and worse and just existing as a person is absolute torture. people tell me that i’ll move on and that things will get better but my anxiety is unbearable and i legitimately can’t wait that long. i was decided on killing myself last week and that state of mind i was in made me do something really stupid and i ruined a friendship because of it, but i didn’t do it and instead ended up crying in the floor of my room for the whole night, man looking back i wish i had done it because i wouldn’t have to live with the fact that i fucked up bad, but i know that deep inside i don’t have the courage for it. i wish there was a button that could make me go back to 2 weeks ago and there’s so much i wouldn’t do, if there were such a thing i’m sure i wouldn’t be in this deep hole i’m in right now.|1

My school has this useless rule that after writing two Fs in an exam you have to repeat the entire school year. I wrote my first one in math earlier this year and while studying today I realized I'm definitely going to fail the second one too. The fact then I'm the only one to blame for that honestly makes it so much worse. If I actually get a F I'm just gonna go straight to nearst Bridge or train station to kms.|1

"Hello fam,

I am blasting music now to stop ruminating and focus on what am i writing, normally music makes me daydream myself to laughter but mostly to cries. These last days i am feeling like i have no sense of self and something is screaming that was the problem all my life. I know i have codependency tendencies but couldnot make sense of why there are two voices (me talking to myself or another person or group of people) chattering in my head all the time. I feel like getting close to whatever is that i never experienced but i wana shut off my mind and feel myself fully for the first of my life. I feel little happier but not congruent with it. Any ideas, advice?

Thank you"|1
"I’ve been thinking about cutting myself a lot. I’ve been well over a year clean from it, but mostly because I was seeing people and didn’t want to freak them out. Even after I stopped seeing people I simply didn’t feel the need to do it anymore. It’s been on my mind more and more lately the past couple months though. I have no better or fulfilling way to deal with my stressors, believe me I’ve put serious effort into trying it all. Today I actually held a blade to my skin over my old scars. I only got a tiny cut before I got a phone call and decided to answer that instead. 

I have nobody I can talk to about this. I feel terrible. I’ve been tossed around the military mental health system and never been given the opportunity to consistently see a therapist even though I’ve tried. A psychologist told me that I “appear to be completely mentally stable” a few days ago and it’s pretty funny because every day I daydream about shooting myself in the head with a shotgun. I just can’t mention suicidal ideology without losing everything I’ve worked for since I graduated high school. 

I’m probably going to just play video games all day and try to forget what’s going on while the stuff that I need to do piles up. Life sucks."|1
"I just graduated university majoring in something I'm not even passionate about. I'm jobless, friendless, zero motivation to do anything, and I don't know how to dig myself out of this hole. I only really started to think about my depression recently despite it being present for as long as I can remember. I was digging through old junk, it really made me think about my past. It reminded me of my old interests, who I was when I was younger, my old friends, everything that was but is no longer. But along with that I also realized that my feelings have never really changed. While I didn't think about it often, I remember being unhappy in school, w/ my homelife, everything. I can't remember the last time I was happy. And throughout it all, when I did think about it, I felt ashamed and pathetic because I never struggled any hardships in life. I have never felt loss, tragedy, or heartbreak. On top of that I've had supportive friends. Maybe that's why I felt I could never open up. Not sure I even know how to open up. Maybe this counts.

I know I'm not alone in this. I'm not the only one who feels this way. Some people have it worse. People say it gets better. I've read it all online. But I don't see an end for me. It's debilitating for no reason. I'm frustrated. I'm sad. I don't know why. 

Sorry if it was incoherent. I don't have anyone I can talk to so I figured I'd post here. Maybe something will come of it."|1
"I'm not sure what this post is for maybe my final attempt of trying to get help from people, or trying to save myself. 

I'm 28 years old and the breadwinner of my family. I'm suffering from grave's disease and mitral valve prolapse that requires me to get surgery that costs around 1 million PHP. 

Last year, despite the pandemic, was a blessing to me. I was able to find a high-paying remote job and was able to support my family and the medicines. However, the people i worked with are pretty shitty. I don't look good, and I'm very low-key at work. My performance is okay, but since they don't like me, they find some faults in my job and decided to remove me from the company without even preparing. They just called me up one morning telling me they decided to separate ways with me. 

It was hard. That job was my lifeline. Maybe I'm not the best at my work but I'm surely doing and completing my task. Because of what happens, I feel so worthless. I lost all my confidence and I do know I have to trust the Lord God to take charge of my life, but I cannot stop worrying. 

My mom is paralyzed, my dad suffers from kidney failure and I'm sick too. It looks like my best isn't enough because I've been looking for a job but I can't find one and I'm so scared to lose them at the same time I'm so tired, so exhausted from fighting. I don't know what to. 
My physical symptoms have been showing because of my high stress level. And because I lost my job I couldn't even afford therapy, or a consultation with a psychologist even if I want too. 

There's this side of me that scared too of dying because I don't wanna leave my parents like that, but at the same time, I want to escape :( 

I'm losing hope. I don't know what to do, and don't know how to fix my thoughts."|1
I lack motivation to do anything. I work, sleep, eat, go out every Saturday & back to square one. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder when i was 17 and after that everything has just kind of been a blur, i dont know of im still depressed or if something is wrong with me but i just cant bring myself to start up a hobby or do anything besides nothing. My lack of communication skills is what stops me from seeing a therapist or getting to know people on a deeper level. I just wanna be normal and function like a regular human being but im scared to get help. Im sorry just needed to vent|1

"Does anyone else feel this way?

POCD-TW

So recently I have developed this fear of me having masturbated to CP years ago. I have no clear memories of anything I just get flashes and they seem really real. I also can’t shake the feeling that I did it, I feel the guilt the unbearable shame and the suicidal ideations. Has anyone else dealt with this I mostly just stuck to Pornhub but sometimes I would use google images and I would visit an uncommon website. I was into cartoon porn but I saw porn invoking real people on the sides and stuff. How can I deal with this? How can I not be miserable? How do I figure out if I really did something?"|1
"Like, I can recognize this in myself. Like, I wish I could be better, but I don't think I want to? Not sure if this makes sense to anyone. I struggle, and I try, and I feel like it's never enough. I feel like I'm in the end stages and I'm seeking refuge in the annonoymity of the interwebs. 
Cause I don't talk to a lot of people. Not in person, not online. This is my first post on Reddit since I've joined. I don't do anything with social media at all. Never been a fan. I honestly have a real hard time with the human disconnect. We aren't designed to live like this, we just aren't...

I dunno. Having a hard time I suppose."|1
I’ve been on 10 mg lexapro for a month. The first 2 weeks i was starting to feel better week three was a little weird and now these last 4-5 days my depression and anxiety have been at an all time high. I took Zoloft for 2-3 months and had a similar experience . I seemed to be getting better then things got bad out of no where. Is 1 month on 10 mg too long to just quit cold turkey?|1
"I don't have many relationships, but the few I do tend to last for many years and I'm very close with them.
But sometimes I get very close to a girl and and when happen to start liking her romantically, I am consistently rejected, even though every single one told me things like ""your partner will be lucky"" or complimented me to no end. Once or twice of this is fine. But it's happened way too many times over many years. I just feel like an empty husk at this point. At first I didn't want to give up on at least trying when things seem like they might go well but now thoughts like ""what's the point?"" are creeping up. 
I was already very numb and showed very little emotion most of the time before the last incident. But now my depression is at an all time high."|1
[21M] Every time I go outside I see cute couples everywhere, I am happy for them but I always come to a realisation that that’ll never be me and it makes me feel fucking worthless. And a solution is not to just try and find a partner because culture/religion always has to fucks things up, and because of this I don’t even know who I really am or what I’m supposed to do. Everything just seems blurred or foggy which is why I can’t see myself lasting another 9 years.|1
I want this misery too end already|1
"I've been severely depressed for the last half a year. I've tried several antidepressants and didn't react to them at all. Lexapro, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Zoloft 100mg and Lamictal 75mg (which I'm currently on). The ""official"" medication didn't do much so I decided to try drugs, anything that had a potential to help me.

Ketamine was a let down. Allegedly it should have helped against depression but after trying 150mg and 350mg, I experienced weird borderline traumatizing mental states and no reduction in depression at all. I tried microdosing lsd, again no perceived effect.

Then I tried ritalin. Holy shit. I felt energy, motivation and emotions for what felt a first time in an eternity. I genuinely smiled, went for a walk, enthusiasticly hung out with my friends.

My psychiatrist wasn't happy about this. He insists that stimulants aren't ment for depression treatment and forces me to try different doses of already failed antidepressant.

Ritalin is no win either, I feel like I'm building a tolerance and the after effects are sometimes daunting and even more debilitating than my vanilla depression.

Still, it's the last instrument for me to reconnect with my past self, the one that experienced happiness, emotions and motivation to do things in life. But after each and every ritalin trip, a sadness sets in, feeling again like a shit as I will prolly feel for the rest of my life."|1
"The past 6 years since graduating college have been miserable on and off. I'm 28 now, and as bad as my depression was before, the past 5 months it has been the worst, and ever since mid-April, it has been nothing short of excruciating mental anguish agony and pain.

There have been periods of months where I have been happy, had a girlfriend, etc. But I have hated by job that my choice of career because in my heart it just doesn't suit me. I've stuck with it anyway because it pays the best (accountant). Big mistake. Coming home from a 9-5 that you hate really sucks the energy and personality out of you. I used to be so fun boisterous and outgoing. I've become nothing like that anymore and I hate it.

I live in Jacksonville, FL now ever since I moved in with some old college acquaintenaces. They aren't friends that I can lean on emotionally and I always feel judged by them, but it's a cheap place to live.

The only thing that has been good about my life as of the beginning of this year was money. I had saved over 30k by sacrificing for a year and a half living very uncomfortably at my girlfriend's mom's house. I accidentally broke up with my girlfriend when I was able to work remotely. Huge mistake. This year I became so depressed and hopeless that everyday was miserable. The only thing I had going for me was that I did have about 30k in the bank and investing. I was such a big investor all throughout 2020, and I loved it. I was a social research investor meaning I used discord and reddit forums and youtube to find the best stock picks. And then.... this happened.....

Huge investing mistakes. Just huge. :( It sucks when you have the correct thesis on an investment, but you are so depressed that you completely miss out on something that goes up 100x in value.  


Despite having a positive thesis on dogecoin as well as other investments, I accidentally never actually invested my money because I was so distracted my depression and video games. It was like I was self-harming financially. I remember growing apathetic about my money and investing. Biggest mistake of my life :( . I was following Elon's tweets, I believed in it, I thought it was going to go up, but from January through April, as I said, I was so depressed. The only thing that gave me any hint of dopamine in my brain was playing my favorite video game at the time (Overwatch). I figured it was okay to play because it brought me out of my darkness for the time that I was playing.   


That was a huge mistake because I completely took my eyes off the wheel in terms of handling my money and investments. I realistically calculated that I would have been a multi millionaire if I hadn't gotten depressed. I know almost for a fact that if I just picked up my laptop and headed over to the coffee shop, that I wouldn't have missed these investing opportunities. I know it's stupid to stress about money, but in this case, it was such a monumental fuck up that I just can't stop being agonized by it every waking moment. Like.... you really couldn't fuck up more than this. The worst part of this is that all the investments I missed out on were things that I would have been in if I wasn't so depressed everyday. It would have changed my life in so many ways. I have almost no family or friends, so money would have made me happier even moreso than it might make other people who do have those other things that bring happiness into their lives.

I don't know how to live with myself anymore. I am so alone and torturted by thoughts of what should have been. I know if I had woken up everyday in January-April, put on my best outfit and headed to the coffee shop to do work (I'm a remote accountant/bookkeeper), that I would have been more focused and would not have ""forgotten"" to invest my money in things I legitimately believed in. Recently I missed out on AMC as well for the same reason. This is all because I fell so behind by being depressed for so many months. It is tough to go on now; when I was already so severely depressed and low key wanted to die everyday, and now I just missed out on the biggest opportunities there may have ever been to make money. I have been in such agony that expressing myself to this community may be my only hope. I don't know if anyone has ever felt as mentally tortured as I do everyday. The only reason I won't realistically off myself is because I couldn't do that to my dad and mom.

I am hoping to connect with others so I feel less alone and so I don't feel like I have to go through this alone anymore. It is not worth it anymore. Other than my depression, I absolutely love who I am. Money isn't everything, but for me it is, given my situation.. as I said.. I don't have family or friends or any of the other good things in life, so money would have made such a difference you have no idea.. :(, and now that I messed that up, I don't know how to live anymore. It's so difficult to focus on things and to keep working when this is all in the back of my head. I try to block it out, but it doesn't work permanently; I keep kicking myself. I already realized that continuing to work through it to try to and not make any more mistakes is the best course of action, but as I write this, my head is throbbing. I sit here in a room for 5 months in absolute misery, and 5 weeks of those 5 months is when it became significantly worse after missing out on those investments that realistically would have made me rich. I'm sure many people on this sub would disagree, but I can't imagine anyone be going through as much emotional and mental agony as me, and if you are, I'd love to connect and lean on each other.

I appreciate any feedback incredibly much. Thank you for reading."|1
everything just always gets worse. i dont know how much more i can tke. this is embarrassing to post but whatever lol. i got diagnosed with glioblastoma (grade 4 brain tumor, terminal, not good) in 2019 and it's been downhill from there it seems. i was depressed as a kid and i didnt really believe it would get better but i did think maybe if i moved out and lived somewhere cool and got friends id be kinda  happy one day. well ill just never have that. its like everyones so focused on treating my cancer they dont care how i feel. im gonna scream if one more person tells me i need a therapist. i KNOW i do but i dont want someone to try to brainwash me into thinking im ok with this. im not ok! everything fucking sucks! this is the third time in like two years that i was gonna see a concert and then i couldnt even get tickets and its like wheres the part of cancer where you get some gifts and pity, i want that. because life in general is so not worth it. and people tell you to focus on the little things but nothing good happens to me and why do i care if the flowers are pretty and whatever. im losing my sense of taste again bc chemo so i cant even comfort myself with food. im 22 and my bones hurt but i always compare myself to worst treatment saying i dont have it bad enough. and its been 2 years so it feels like all my friends are sick of hearing about it (verified by some of them leaving me) and resent me for not being a better friend and it makes me mad but idk what people want from me either im a shell of a person it just gets worse and worse and i tell myself itll be okay that im going to die alone and in pain and absolutely worthless never really impacted anyones life and i should enjoy things as they happen but i genuinely think im cursed, i really do, i have such bad luck i watch all my friends get to experience all the things they want and i cant tell them im not happy for them im so jealous because its like im dying and i cant even go to a concert im so sad i dont care if i survive i just screamed into my pillow for ages today and i feel so hopeless|1
"As for most of us, for the past year I had to deal with major life changes, one of which was having to cancel my wedding due to covid restrictions. Anxiety and depression came knocking, went back to therapy, left my fiance 6 months ago,moved back to my family home.

I have been dealing with this situation since, no medication, only therapy. It has been a couple of weeks now that I have an intense feeling of ""depression inception"", meaning that I experience a depressive episode while still dealing with my depressive episode.

Does this make sense to anyone? Anybody felt like this?"|1
"preface: this may be a little jumbled but i just needed to brain vomit.

i moved in with my best friend about a year ago and everything was fine at first (outside of normal depression problems). this year happened to be the most depressed year of my life due to obvious pandemic stuff and a horrible breakup/suicide attempt right before it started. the first thing that goes when i’m depressed is my energy. with low energy comes bad cleanliness so my room was a wreck most of the time but i did my absolute best to not be a dick and leave stuff out. obviously that slipped up every now and then but yeah. also the other day i got a cat without telling him and i come to find out he’s allergic. i know i was wrong. being a depressed person i have a really hard time confronting people and asking for something and i’ve been rather impulsive lately. totally owning being the shitty roommate. he’s collected. has his life together. i’m a burnout who’s too spineless to ask a lifelong friend a simple question. 

i feel like this year living together ruined our friendship. i started feeling bad about our relationship about halfway through the year when he started making passive aggressive remarks about my weed smoking which is weird because i never smoke inside and he used to smoke with me before he got a job that prohibited that. for whatever reason i felt like our relationship took a tank. we used to hang out together get drunk, make dinner and stuff and now he does everything in his power to not be in the house (even before i got the cat). i also got a girlfriend around december and i feel like all i ever felt from him was salt. every casual conversation turned into him trying to dunk on me for no good reason and every joke had to come at my expense. i felt lonely in a home with my best friend so i got the cat. i did what i did and i’m gonna live with it but god this living situation sucks. 

my lease is up at the end of july thank god.


tldr i’m a terrible roommate but i feel like my roommate contributed to worsening my depression which made me a worse roommate idk"|1
"I have been talking to people who has suffered from depression for 10 years. When you go to internet or talk to people say that depression episodes last for 6 months or so,

"Hey guys. I read a lot of the posts and haven't made one myself. Wanted to start off by saying you're all great people and even though we all have our flaws with whatever mentalhealth/ depression/disoreder related issues may be. We all deserve to be happy and live a fulfilling life. I'm 21 now and after 4 years of depression, a few suicide attempts  and a lot of selfharm, I am finally at peace and beginning to blossom like a flower again(Warning: this should really and truly be an Alt/throwaway account but I feel this is the only way I can legitimately express how I feel and give closure to my family if they may read this xoxo, Love you Moona. 

I was pretty much a normal kid. A-C grades,loved video game development and helped with an Indie Game called Indie Game Battle, soundcloud as a hobby and got verified on Spotify as an artist.
Up until I started college around age 16/17, I suffered from mild anxiety in front of classes but I was otherwise outgoing, maybe trying to fit in a lot...

Until my uncle(40) began temporarily living with us. To make a long story short around that age I was still trying to figure out who I was and I my family had no issue with my uncle being gay. The issue was the way he'd make comments about me and my Twin brother, or make sexual inueded jokes or touch me specifically. Not full on assault just ""jokes"", After sometime smoking weed at home/college my uncle began playing This kind of conquer and divide chess kinds mind games where if I had anger or frustration outburst at my mom he would kinda ensure there was a divide between us especially. When my anxiety and depression towards end of first year got really bad. 

One night, I was smoking in the tent in our garden(Afrixan household in the UK, no way smoking indoor) when he came into the tent. We were speaking normally and just smoking when he randomly pecked. Me. On the lips. Now me, age 16/17 very emotional at the time and unstable cried? Almost instantly, I didn't like that at all. I felt frozen as if if I didn't leave the tent from that moment he might rape me. 

Thank god my grandma smelt the weed and told me to come inside. He waited me to leave first then he went in. After that night my depression got super bad where I couldn't tell my sister, mum or brother about it because I was scared, confused and didn't wanna mess up the money he was paying my Mum to stay with us(he works in mental health/Jewish care(, ironic..😥). We really needed it at the time. To supplement the pain, and just being a dumb teen. I played it off as ""everything's okay"" but clearly became disconnected dornsttstched from reality. I was taking a lot of Cocsine, krt, weed and xansz in college and soon after I began self-harming almost every single other day. It was around midsummer. 


Will continue after xozo"|1

I'm 19 and I still live with my mom because I can't currently afford living anywhere else and it's pretty much the best option for me right now. And though I appreciate it and I apprieciate things she's done for me, I feel like she's just pushed me away so much to the point of not even caring. And look i'm not gonna sit here and call my mother a terrible person or a great person, she's neither, she has her good and bad qualities. I know she cares and she tries to help with my depression sometimes but others it's like she's a completely different person and every time I try to explain any way i'm feeling towards her it's like i'm talking to a brick wall. I'm not gonna detail our entire relationship because I don't wanna get too deep into my personal life. Can i really deny the fact that she makes me absolutely miserable just because I live in her house and because she loves me?

It's tearing me apart that I just feel nothing for either of them, especially my mom. But there's nothing I can really do."|1
"Hello,
Does anyone feel comfortable talking about when they were formally diagnosed with major depression, or any other mental illness? If so, do you think your diagnosis was accurate or has it been changed since you started treatment?

I'm asking because I'm not satisfied with the effectiveness of any of the medications I've tried, and since my diagnosis has changed repeatedly over the last 10+ years, I'm starting  to think I'm not even taking the right things."|1
I'm listening to music to try and drown out the voices in my head 😢|1
"and the thing is, i’m not even angry at you. i am angry at the situation and what happened, and i am angry that i lost what could’ve been. and i am angry that i wasn’t good enough and treated you like shit and that i still feel like i deserve all the hate and pain you give me because you received so much hate and pain from me.

but logically, i know i didn’t intend to hurt you. my mental health was shit. it still is shit. i want to be redeemed so badly; i want you to understand so you can love me again the way i want you to. but i don’t get to make that decision for you. i don’t get to make that choice. so now i have to move on and make a new plan after a whole year of believing that i’d still be able to live with you. i don’t want to give up on you, but i don’t have time to wait for things to heal and get better because life doesn’t work that way. 

i’ve already punished myself enough. if you could love me the way i deserve, then you wouldn’t treat me the way you’re treating me right now. but i don’t you don’t have that capability right now. i don’t have the capability to love you the way you deserve either.  come back when you’re finally strong enough to do so. i’ll come back when i’m strong enough too."|1
It's 1.30 AM for me. I think about the concept of infinite afterlife and I find it scary I also find scary the concept of just not existing. I'm not sure if I qualify in here but I feel so bad. I had those thoughts for last few years and I'm still a teenager.|1
I used to enjoy life so much, now I just struggle and try so hard to feel happy. I’m not saying I’m looking forward to death, but it’s just a shame that dying is the only way I’ll find true happiness and peace. I wanna be happy and live, where it kinda matters the most for me. What if there’s no afterlife etc etc. it just sucks man|1

Why was I the abuser?

I started dating Bo when I was 20 he was 29. I always thought we connected well we both had a dark sense of humor and love for film. He worked a decent job but over his life had bouts of depression where he has significant gaps in his resume. He didn't finish university because even though he went to a phenomenal university, he said the classes didn’t interest or challenge him enough. I



I work and go to school part-time at a university in the Los Angeles area. About six months into our relationship, he quit his job because he said they were not letting him progress. He had to move home to Denver in with his parents because he couldn't afford rent. I was devastated and hurt because I tried to talk to him about options for a new job, but he was stubborn and refused. I bring up how much it hurt he left he says he doesn't feel bad he did nothing wrong




He has been home for a year and a half not working because he says his depression is so severe. When he moved back, he tried to talk to me about suicide. I said I'm not a professional I love you, but you need to speak to a doctor I can't handle that. He brings up consistently how I abounded him in his time of need. He had gone to a residential treatment place before but left because he thought they were ripping him off and that their advice was terrible. I stopped dating him officially after he moved but still talked to him.




He would say that I'm a liar. He would always try to catch me in lies like ask me aggressively if I've taken my sleeping meds (I'm proscribed this) I feel awkward to put on the spot so I say no then he goes and counts my pills. If I send him a photo, he's checked the metadata to see if I'm lying and if I don't say the exact date he calls me a liar.


He says I lie more than anyone he knows. He brings up the time I drank some of my roommate's juice or smoked one of her cigs and said I didn't. We will be texting every day frequently. He’ll ignore me for days saying he can't talk because of the depression I get upset and try to text him.



He says I'm entitled and I'm not allowed to someone's attention that I need to learn boundaries. He would bring up regularly how he misses perks from his old job. If I ever criticized him or lost my temper with him he would say I’m the meanest person he’s ever met. When I bring up the mean stuff he’s said about me he says “everything I say about you is objective fact with evidence behind it everything you say is a petty insult”



I would say to him he quit that job for no reason he could quickly get it back or live with that choice. He says I'm mean because I never let him vent. He always tells me my memory is terrible and reminds me about lies in the past. When I try to bring up something from the past, he says,” I trust my memory MORE THAN YOURS.” When I lost my temper he’s sent screenshots of the texts to mutual friends making me look bad. I would never send private texts to a mutual friend.



His plans are nothing at this point he says he's just there that he isn't going to kill himself but too depressed to work. I stopped talking to him because of other reasons, but I can't stop shaking the feeling. Do I come off as a liar? Do I sound like a bad liar? I have bad anxiety and feel not open; sometimes, I go to therapy twice a week.



tl;Dr: Guy I dated for a little accuses me of being a liar."|1
"I (17M) have been friends with a girl (16F) for about 4 weeks now.  
About 3 weeks ago I told her I like her and she told me she needs to know someone for a while before she can get feelings for them.  
I have a mild form of autism, a part of which causes me to want to know everything as precise as possible, and I also have pretty heavy depression.  
She is on my mind pretty much all day, and she's one of the very few things that make me happy.  
But everytime I think about her, it hurts, and I start to wonder if I actually want it to work, or if it's just the depression.  
I have also never been in a relationship so I have know idea what the protocols are."|1
"Hi, I’m 24M, need some counseling. I’ve been diagnosed with strong depression by my doc, spent 8 months with Effexor 150mg, last pill I took was 5-6weeks ago as my psychiatrist said I was doing good (and I felt I was doing good), but now I feel like shit again. 

I work at a big tech company (not in FAANG, but would be the M in FAANG if
FAANG had an M), and have had a great career thus far. I’m pursuing a masters degree in computer science, but failing the two classes I’m taking as after work I’m so tired to be able to study let alone spend time in classes. 

My work isn’t stressful (thank goodness) but I still feel bad after work as I’m failing school, I get suicidal and think about how great it’d be if I just fell asleep and died… I’m about to get a loan for a new house I’ve been paying for the past 2 years, and although it excites me, I’m still struggling to get by day by day. 

I’m not sure what to do. Leave the degree? Get back to pills? 

Ive been told I should be more grateful of what I have, but literally all Ive accomplished has been because of how anxious I am. Good grades? Me getting anxious and studying a lot because “I can’t fail”. Good paycheck? Me getting anxious of not having a job that can provide me with enough money to buy whatever I want and spend money however I want. I don’t know, I’m in a bad mood and I would really appreciate some words or advice. 

Ive been in a relationship since I’m 15, my gf knows me from top to bottom,  but I don’t want to involve her in yet one more depression episode. She’s been too good with me and all I do in my life I feel is for her greater good."|1
"I need some closure and second opinions
Me and this girl met (Both freshman in college going on sophomores) and then saw each other for 3 months at college and texted every second we could, went partying and slept together a lot. We both confessed that we had feelings for each other and were exclusive at the end of the semester, but we live 6 hours away and decided that we should do our own thing for 3 months, but she said she “wanted to hear everything about my summer unless I did something with someone else”. 

Looking back this wasn’t the best decision but it didn’t seem like it until now because for the following 3 weeks we texted every chance we could, talked all day everyday, we’re #1 bf on Snapchat for 4 months and things felt like they were the same. I had to wake up at 3:30am for work one morning and she set an alarm and called me which to me seemed like she at least was still very into me if not relationship wise at least best friends. 

Then 2 days later she would respond to my Snapchat’s just with pictures of the wall and wouldn’t keep a conversation going, and eventually stopped snap chatting me until around 12 hours later she would respond. I asked her if everything was ok and she said that she just didn’t like Snapchat atm and would be fine. The next day she didn’t Snapchat me back in time, our streak ended, and she now has a new #1 best friend on Snapchat. 

I sent her a long message saying I can’t tell if you still want to talk to me and it hurts me you won’t talk to me but if you don’t want to talk just tell me and I will deal with it. She responded like 12 hours later with a long paragraph that seemed very genuine saying she is dealing with some depression atm and she pushes people away when that happens and that’s she’s really sorry if she made me feel that way Bc that wasn’t her intent and she really is sorry. (She told me before we left when she goes home she isn’t super happy because of her situation with family and work so I kind of believe her here but I still dk). 

I said I believe you but I don’t understand really but that’s ok. I said sorry for being weird I’ll leave you be if you want and she replied I’m really sorry if I made you feel that way I really am and that she doesn’t think I’m being weird at all. I then said ok and sent her a picture of me but she opened it, left me on read, and took me off her private story and took herself off of mine. It’s been 24 hours and she hasn’t said anything and I don’t know what to do. I know I am still young but I just need help right now dealing with my anxiety. Not depressed, just anxious whether we will be friends again or more or if this is the last time I’ll ever speak with her. 

Looking for advice on what to do and what you think of the situation, whether she is lying or telling the truth or if maybe she found someone else. Thank you!
(Side note: she hasn’t blocked me on Snapchat or Instagram and still sees my regular stories so she hasn’t cut me off or completely ghosted me, but the story still stands)"|1
Literally everyone says it's my fault cuz I'm a pussy who cant stand up for myself and I'm a pushover and everyone says I hurt people and therefore I deserve it even my boyfriend said I say things to cause hurt in people is it all my fault I feel like killing myself|1
"So basically my family is really fucking complicated. My grandma (mom’s mother) is a schizophrenic older woman from Thailand, and she moved to Sweden when she met my grandpa around 45 years ago. They then had two kids (one of which is my mom) and got divorced directly after. My grandma was in no condition to take care of a child, so mom and her brother were raised by my grandpa and his second ex wife. 
All my life I’ve always seen my grandfather’s ex wife as my grandmother. Basically the only people I care about in my life are her relatives and children, grandchildren etcetera. They’re all directly related. 
So well, I’m 14 years old and today I met my “real” grandmother for the first time. She invited us into her apartment because she was too afraid to come outside. The living room was completely dark except for the light coming from the TV. The whole apartment stank of cigarette smoke. The couch was ripped and dirty and there was stuff laying around everywhere. I could barely understand what she was saying even though she’s lived here for almost 50 years. She said my little sister (who looks very Swedish and not Asian at all) was “very pretty” and “very blonde”, and after a while she looked at me and said “...well, you’re tall.” She then proceeded to tell us how she had been talking to the (dead) president yesterday, and that he “gave her 800$, which she was very thankful for.” (And also pointing out that my mom had gotten fat and had to go on a diet.)

I don’t know what I expected really. I guess I was hoping she’d be in a good enough condition to actually be able to create some kind of relationship with me. Not that I need closeness from her really, I already have a grandmother who I love very much but now that I’ve met my real one I feel like I don’t belong in my family anymore and that I’m way different from all my cousins and relatives. When I hadn’t met her I could imagine her being whatever I wanted. All of my relatives on my dads side of the family are dead too, and my parents are divorced so the only family I really have are my moms side who aren’t even actually my family."|1
"Anyone else feel like the only times they're happy is when they're asleep? 
I for the most part have great dreams of living in a fictitious world where I have powers, in a story or in a game or something. Then I wake up to the dull, bleak, crushing reality that is wage slaving at a warehouse for 40+ hours a week destroying my back in a life where my only relief is being asleep, or being on drugs. Some way to escape this world. I hate being alive so much and I wish that I hadn't been born or that someone could put me out of my misery. There has to be something other than capitalism and wasting the vast majority of my life earning wealth for rich people."|1
"Can't stop thinking about this quote lately. My depression started when I was 14 and have been with me for the last 8 years. I fought it hard until I couln't take it anymore and gave up. Interestingly enough, giving up was the way for me to come to peace with my demons. I stopped looking for happiness and instead embraced the sadness and everything depression includes.

I've been ""my new self"" for 5 months now. Things were going as usual. I was having suicidal thoughts pretty much daily, nothing new for me. I was always sad, angry and easily irritated and even though I chose not to fight it, I suffered. Alone.

And then it all stopped. Everything I felt just.. disappeared. A month later, I'm sitting here making this post to let whoever reads this know that I've never been this lost. How fucking ironic it is that I miss depression so much? Just when I thought I finally discovered who I am, the thing that defined me just vanished. I've never been so emotionless and empty. I find myself ignoring my friends when they struggle and come to me for advice or even pushing them away by saying I have no good advice for them and they should find a better friend. I NEVER DID THAT BEFORE.

I'm not a fighter, never been in a fight but I've been fantasizing about hurting people recently, and by people I mean bad people. Am I becoming a bad person? An emotionless psychopat? Do I have BPD or what the fuck is happening to me?

Sorry but I feel like I'm losing my mind and had to vent."|1
"I just feel awefull for few days. I shutted myself in my flat in this time, doing nothing, with exploding migrene, feeling of tiredness, apathy.... Etc. You know the drill. My friends wanted to get me out of the flat but I refused feeling like bag of shit without energy to pretend to be someone else. I have exam on Monday so I wanted to get out of this miserable state. Coffe, energy drinks, pain killers - nothing helped. So I decided that I need to get out to feel somewhat normal.
Boy. It took me about two hours. Not to make myself look good but to make myself get out. In my paranoid brain there was an image that people will literally laugh when they see me.
But I get myself to do it. I decided that I want to be in control of my body, and that I will Take this step by step. After 10 minutes of taking walk and listening of music I felt SO MUCH BETTER. I ended up walking around 30 minutes - 1 hour. I feel better, I have motivation, I do not care what people think about how I look. 
I have No idea how it works,  but if you have similiar situation like mine I recommend making yourself getting out of bed and Take that damn walk. You’ll feel better."|1
"
Backstory: I'm a 21 year old girl, my whole life my dad has been the hardest on me between my two brothers in school. I worked my ass off from middle school up until now busting my ass off in school and I've been an honor student all those years, and Magna Cum Laude in college. 

I became an honor student because I was scared of him, scared of him yelling, calling us names, hitting us for not doing our homework when we were kids. It has made me an adult who doesn't know life without school. It has made me a person who wants to take extra classes because I'm too scared to relax when I'm done with college.

I changed my major four times from nursing, to psychology, to criminal justice, to dental hygiene. In my heart I know I want to do Forensic Biology, it's what I've always been interested in. Him being a filipino father, was against it. It was either doctor, nurse, or dentist. After fighting about ""how much money I'll make"" vs. ""what I'll enjoy doing/what I'm passionate about"", we settled on dental hygiene (mainly leaning towards his opinion). I was miserable because I spent 1.5 years taking classes I didn't need and I was already behind my classmates I graduated high school with. Also being a person who was always on top of school, I stressed about having to take new classes to fulfill the prerequisites for a Dental Hygiene program. 

I have one class left as a prerequisite to take and then I can finally enroll in a DH program. Today, my dad asked me what my plan for school is, which threw me off because he never asks about school. He is clueless about me being an honor student all these years, my plan for DH, whenever he brings up school, it's to make sure I havent switched my major back criminal justice. I recently got my Associate's degree in Health Science due to the prerequisite classes I took for the DH program. Today, he asked me why I'm going to school for 6 years just for a Bachelors in Dental Hygiene. I told him it was because I wasted the first half of college taking classes that were useless to the degree I switched to. He then told me to just get a Bachelors in Health Science then. At that point I started out crying (as stupid as it is) because school has always been a stressor in my life. Working so hard in school and worrying about disappointing my dad led me to being diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety last year. I was put on Zoloft and Atarax and of course he doesn't know about that. (I never told him because he thinks Depression isn't real.) Anyway, I felt useless at that point. I had just switched to Dental Hygiene, I had my plan set for a year already, and he just wants me to get a Bachelors in Health Science just so I could get a Bachelors already. He doesn't know how hard school is on me. He thinks it's so easy to switch majors, not realizing it screws up my whole plan, and I usually do whatever he wants because I just want him to be proud of me. But getting older (and now having daddy issues lmfao) I'm no longer tolerating it. 

He also had the audacity to tell me, ""I never forced you to do anything."" when I was forced to switch from a major I was actually passionate about multiple times. When he forced me to go on the nursing route right when I graduated high school. He then asked me, ""Am I wrong for asking? Do I just not ask any questions?"". He's manipulative and I'm not stupid. He's forced me to switch majors multiple times, I had to turn down university offers because I was not allowed to move away from home. I turned down so many opportunities just for him. And to answer his question, yes he shouldn't ask any questions. He only cares about the money I will make and expects me to give money to him when I become successful, he doesn't care about my mental health (he doesnt think its real), he expects so so much of me and I'm tired of doing everything he wants. He wants to be successful through my life because he wasnt in his. But my life is my life. And I'm tired of being depressed, I'm tired of seeking his acceptance, I'm tired of beating myself up just for him to be a proud dad when nothing I do is ever enough for him."|1
me and my boyfriend have been dating for nearly 8 months and his mental health has declined badly recently, there's a 7hr time zone between us so its my evening time when he wakes up,, his mam passed a few years back and his dad is abusive so his house isn't the best.  he's struggling recently, he's being diagnosed with insomnia as well so his sleep isn't great and its getting worse. he's suicidal and its the hardest thing right now, he's begging me to let him khs every morning, I cant lose him and it feels like I'm going too soon, I'm just asking for some advice on how to be there or just something tbh, anything is appreciated and I hope everyone's well today <3|1
"I’m applying to be an egg donor and I met the basic requirements. However, I realized almost all members of my immediate family has depression and my grandfather even committed suicide. I remember taking a test as a teenager to see if my depression was hereditary and the doctor said it was not….weird. I am not on medication for depression currently nor have I attempted suicide/been hospitalized. I believe everyone’s depression in my family is/was situational. I just hope they take in to consideration that the depression is not hereditary, even though it appears that way.

*I’m not here to know the pros and cons of egg donation. I already did a lot of research. I just need to know if it’s a chance they could disqualify me for depression running in the family even if it’s not hereditary."|1

He was a really nice person. He did everything for our family. Loved me loved my mom. Idk. Some years ago it changed. He began arguing with my mom. He became more of an asshole to me. Idk why. He began drinking. Flirting with other women. He even became violently. I saw so many bad things with the age of 9. I became depressed. Had an failed suicide attemp when I was 14. He didn't really cared. He ignored it that I told him he was the reason. Today I'm 17 and nothing changed to the better. No. It got worse. Everytime I look into his face. I feel anger. But... I get that thought of the past.... I remember how he loved me when I was 7... I remember how he did many nice things with me and my mom. I see how everything changed. How I have no control over this. Everytime I get those thoughts I really just wanna take a knife and kill myself. I can't believe how such a nice person got ruined by things I dont understand and can't explain. I rather want to be dead|1
"I’m still depressed all the time. All I think about is how much I miss my early-2020 life. It was perfect. I was happy. I was the happiest I’d ever been. Then I hit rock bottom. I still haven’t recovered. The sadness, and longing for my past life to return is uncontrollable. I’ve been crying almost every day just cause I want it all back so bad.

I just feel so lonely and down all the time. I don’t even know why I feel this way but I want more than anything for it to stop. I haven’t even really had a real smile in so long.. 

I’m starting to feel like I’m losing myself.. I just want to be happy again I want this to go away I’m so sick of being unhappy. 

It doesn’t help that since it’s depression and not just some emotion I never know why I feel this way, I just do. Since I don’t know why it makes me question if I even have the right to be this sad. It’s like I’m overreacting or something. I just feel worthless, like I don’t matter to anyone.

I’m so mentally exhausted, I’m not really eating I’m barely sleeping but then I have days where all I want to do is cry and sleep for hours upon hours. It takes everything I have not to breakdown at night. 

Anytime I talk to anyone I just don’t want to open up because anytime I do I feel like I don’t have the right to feel this way or they just don’t seem to care. Especially since I can’t explain it. 

Whenever someone has something else going on I just put my problems aside because I feel like it’s not as important. Which just makes it build up more and I become even more down. I don’t know what to do. 

Nothing helps, the medicine I’m on does nothing. I’ve been going to therapy but after each session I just feel even worse after it. I’m just beyond lost. 

I put everything I can into attempting to help people go through things or at least try to be there for them, but I can’t do anything to help myself. I feel so useless.. I just want someone to be there for me like I am for them.

Just someone please help me.."|1

Some broken things may be fixed. But not you. You're a joke. Something to never be cared for. Someone who has felt love, and also felt loss.

"Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

I'm currently in 12th grade, which is my last year of school. I need to do a presentation as my last exam, so that I get my degree ( not sure what its called in English). I feel so sick, this is literally the last time I have to do school and I can't get myself to motivate. I have been sitting in front my Laptop for 2 hours and only read the beginning of one Wikipedia article. I can't concentrate, my mind wanders off the whole time, I also have no interest in the presentation I have to do. 

&#x200B;

I know I could do it, but whenever I get myself to think about it, I feel like I'll throw up. I just want it to be over, It's so easy, but I can't do it nonetheless. I hate doing presentations, but i'm not even worried about that yet. I have to write everything down and explain all that I'll talk about in the presentation. How do people do this man? I try to drink water so my head doesn't hurt, but even water tastes bad. It's already exhausting to sit on a chair.

"I have the constant feeling that I annoy my friends and that they will get tired of me or they don't enjoy the time we spend together, that the more they know me they like me less. (This fears are maximized when it's about my crush) I know my mind makes up a lot of this but sometimes I feel it's not just in my thoughts, that maybe if we spend less time together recently is because they are really getting tired of me. Whenever I think about talking to them about this (I already did, but obviously I didn't get rid of this so I need to do it again sometimes) I feel like I'm pushing this fears to become true at some point. Also this need of attention and assurance makes me think I'm being toxic and that adds a lot more to all of this.

"This is a rant. Just a warning.

I have to work in an hour. And instead I think I'm just going to drive around and think of ways to kill myself. 

I'll be doing so good at a job but I always end up waking up a week or two in, full to the brim of suicidal thoughts and the need to escape. The job I have right now isn't too bad, I do feel like I'm in the way when I'm there. And every one is annoyed with my presence. And I constantly feel like I don't fit in at all.

I've been through three jobs in the past two or three months. And the same cycle happens. My suicidal thoughts will either be too intense to cope and I call out, resulting in me being fired. Or I'll be so anxious and terrified about messing up that I psych myself out and just don't show up. 

I can't break my cycle, and I feel too stupid to work. The type of depression I live with is medication resistant and I have no money or insurance for therapy. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated.

"Hey people on Reddit.

I searched for something to help my girlfriend to cope with the lots of feelings you have when you live with a partner who is depressive. 

In this Situation I am the depressed one. I 'applied' for therapy and right now I am waiting to get the call from the psychiatric facility to tell me, when they will have a place for me to get the long overdue therapy I need. But as I am already depressed for already 16 years now (i'm 29 now, depression started with 13) I know that there is not gonna be a miracle healing and that there will be a lot of work to do even after therapy. 

Reddit helped me a lot to make the step to get professional help, and i'm incredibly thankful for that. 

But I am Not alone. My girlfriend never had depression in her family and she actually doesn't know what it really is. When s*** goes down for me ( as it sometimes just happens with Depression for me ) and I start to be irrational, anxious and start isolate myself because I have times when all Hope seems lost and the end of time seems close, she doens't know how to Deal with me and she feels responsible when she triggers it and of course worst of all, helpless because she loves me and want me to feel better, but doens't know what to do. 

For myself, I know that it's not her fault, because sometimes it's just a tender push over the edge to go down for me. But why and when I am open for such a trigger, that I don't know. And neither does she. And neither do I know what the trigger will be, as different situations sometimes just bring different triggers ( i.e. stress, trauma) and I cant put them in a pattern ( I tried, a Lot ) because sometimes I get depressed without a trigger. 

So this is not for us depressed nuts, but for the people who still decide to live with us and don't want to give up on us. My girlfriend doesn't use Reddit but if this post gets Attention, I wanna show her and connect her to you people. 

I know she is not the only Person in this situation. And I want to give these people and my girlfriend a place where they can feel understood. So If you struggle with a similar situation or know somebody who does, lead them  here to share their Story. I think this people deserve this attention because sometimes they are the ones keeping us alive."|1
"What's up everyone,

So I am a heavyset guy, over 340lbs, 5'10 and it feels like my wife does not want to have sex with me anymore. Not only that, I am pear shaped and have gynecomastia (had since 15, but never payed it no mind until now). I made a joke to my wife saying that, maybe if I looked like the Rock or Thor that she would want to do it more often, she said no, but I know deep down that it is true.

I notice when people look at me, they usually dont look at my face, they either look at my legs or gyno. I can't wear ""fashionable"" clothing due to this so all I do is wear lose clothing and all black. 

I work a blue collar job that doesn't pay that well unless I'm slaving 14 hours a day and it seems all of my friends can go on vacation when they want (corporate jobs) because they make significantly more than I do. They don't rub it in or show off however i feel like I'm holding the team back when I can't go.

I am trying to find motivation for the gym, but I just cant. I am not sure if I am depressed yet or just realizing I need to get off of my ass and get to it!!!"|1
"I like to draw. I post my drawings on instagram but why am I posting????!. Idk I like it when people say ""wow ur such a great artist"". I love my birthdays just because atleast on that day people treat me specially, notice me but sometimes ppl don't even remember my birthday.i feel  like I'm pretending to be depressed to get some attention. I want someone to notice me, talk to me, idk even this might be a ploy to get some attention ."|1
"I will probably spend the rest of my life in a mental hospital, because i cant take ""care"" of myself. 

How do i accept this? Are there people with a similar fate? How to endure this, especially the resulting boredom, and isolation? Is this really for my own good? 

How do i accept that my life is over?"|1
I don’t know what to do anymore. All I wanna do is sleep and stay asleep. I don’t feel like I’m good at anything. I lost my job from Covid-19 and I’m scared to get a new one because it makes me suicidal. I want to get a job in art instead but I don’t feel good enough. I really just want to sleep.|1
Does anyone else become incredibly depressed all of the sudden? (usually with other people) like one moment i’ll be calm and fine i guess, and then suddenly i become painfully depressed and want to go home. sometimes it’s mid-sentence or conversation; i just want to go home because i get so uncomfortable. maybe it’s my social anxiety but idk... it’s more of a depressed feeling than anxious|1
i know why one did i don't know anything about the others. life just seems so bleak now and it's just hard to love or trust anyone anymore my cutting is also getting very bad. i wish i got closure atleast but maybe i don't deserve that either. i don't know what to do how to even feel remotely yeah. nvm.|1
I’ve been a very deep thinker since I was a child did great in middle school and now that I’m in highschool everything seems so bland. I’m in 9th grade and life just seems pointless I mean we learn and do all this stuff just to die and forget it all. What’s even the point in that. I study consciousness, drugs, and astronomy whenever I can which doesn’t help because the more you know the more shitty the world seems. Especially at my point where I have a very great understanding of consciousness and life I know we’re just perceiving this reality. It annoys me because whenever I think about these things or have these thoughts it annoys me I just wanna go back to being a happy kid. But it hurts because I know that’s over and there’s no going back to a kid. Is this just growing up and I’m overreacting? Or is all my studying just getting to me because I know so much about how the world around me works.|1
"when i was 7 or something i predicted i'd be dead by my own hand at 25, which my mother then made me compromise to 35. that young i knew the truth of my existence

put simply, all of the things i think would make life worthwhile to live are completely unachievable for me. i'd like to be an artist, a writer of some kind, and yet i don't have high enough skill or the willpower to gain high enough skill to actually go anywhere in really any creative field. I basically value nothing else in life other than creating something good, so given my complete incapability to do so, the only logical solution is suicide"|1
I’m just feeling like a failure at 26 years old. Yes I have a degree and I’m engaged and pursuing the career I want but I’m just not happy. Currently battling my 3rd stint of depression, can’t drive, can’t keep a job, have a learning difficulty that makes it feel like I’m playing life on hard mode and I’m just sick of myself. Sick of losing weight but never being able to keep it off, sick of getting on a role of ok days then something bad happening, sick of being forced to do things I don’t want to do like dying feels so much more convenient for myself and everyone else; life comes down to money and it feels like I’m taking a toll on everyone around me just to try and function. Do I really wanna do this for another 40/50 years? Not really|1

"lost a couple close friends as a result of more drama with this girl as well. 

honestly though, having people who hate me gives me so much motivation to be a better me. the only revenge i want is for her to realize i’m completely fine without her and her to know she fucked up."|1
"I’m such a weak fucking human being. Everytime I tell myself that I’ll overcome an OCD obsession of mine & start bettering myself I end up hitting rock bottom again within 1-2 days.

Everytime that I allow myself to feel a glimmer of hope it just gets snatched away and I fall right back into this state of depression.. I’m hopeless.. I give up."|1
"I failed everything and everyone. What is the use of living if it's clear you are not worthy, not enough and not wanted. Everyone abandons you. You hate yourself and you can not trust anyone... I am drowning and pain and defeat. Even I lost myself.

I need somehow to disappear.

Lonq story somewhat short: I was an abandoned child and adopted at almost 4years old.  At 6 I moved with my family in USA, then an abusive year at school in Romania, where I am from, then we left again for three years in Belgium, returned in 2009 in Romania, went to high-school, the first love broke me and I have been suffering for 10years, I became depressed, finished psychology but I did not enter master, I work at a warehouse, I am with a man that does not love me  for fours years, I am still affected by my past. I have always had a difficult time with my family and family specially with my dad. They criticise severely. I have a brother that has autism-I was jealous  he got all the attention and did some horrible things that now haunt me and I regret deeply. Oh and last year in September I left home and I am back home since April 21. My dad is so difficult to bare.. Daily life is... OK but sometimes I see how much of a nothing I have become... Its all my fault... Since that guy broke me, my first love.
The person I am with is shallow and comes from a modest backround and is as modest affectionately, as modest in comunicating  but loves superficial things like reddit, games and porn... That hurts too, as a woman. He is very poor in a matter of being and its  difficult to settle to these differences that shouldn't matter, but do. He is good but very difficult and distant. 

At work, it's a toxic place where people are very mean and do all sorts of malicious things, there is a lot of bragging and backstabbing. The boss even he is encourages it and takes part of it. Horrible low class women that are like a nest of vipers. 

I can barely find a new job.. And at home I am barely noticed, only if I did something wrong.. 

Every day I pull myself.. 

... I am exhausted and tired if living... Especially unwanted."|1
I'll have phases where I may not be as intensely suicidal as I am right now and may even want to better my life or myself as a person, but it is always temporary and leaves me exhausted. I always come back to the same place. I deep down have no desire to make my life better or make myself better in any way. In fact, all I want to do is make my life worse until I can no longer stand it so I can finally disappear from the face of the earth. My friends and family know I'm depressed, but they have no clue that I have no intention of getting better. They would probably be judgemental of me for feeling this way, and might even just write me off as being dramatic or overly negative and stop talking to me. I hate myself so intensely that I look back at times where I was not as depressed with disgust. The thought of me having hope at any point in the past is just ridiculous and makes me want to cut myself because I was being so stupid. How could I ever think that I deserve to be anything more than dead? I am disgusted when I look in the mirror. The figure staring back at me makes me want to claw my eyes out. And for some reason, I'm spilling out all of my thoughts in this post. I am disgusted with myself for even typing this all out.|1
Does anyone feel like they have a limit of how many activities they can do within one day? My bf can go from activity to activity without getting tired but my max is 2-3 (3 is pushing it). I feel like I have a threshold of energy which gets depleted with everything extra curricular I have to do.|1
i dunno how people continue. how does someone wake up and think that the day will be of work. i’m stuck in a rut of waking up to go to my mediocre part time night shift job only return home and feel empty again. i’m on a treadmill of misery and no one gets it, i’ve applied here there and everywhere for another job with more hours and get silence in response. i see all my friends getting hitched to Significant partner and yet here i stand alone facing issues without a lifeline or anyone caring for me. i have though about just sending tommy car into a tree and becoming nothing but a puddle amongst twisted metal. nothing means anything to me anymore, life seems more like a heavy burden to have on my shoulders. i just feel like the cold embrace of death is soon to touch me before the warm embrace of someone who cares for me. what gets y’all up everyday, what keep you moving forward. living for myself seems pointless, a zero sum game. i don’t understand how to be happy anymore.|1
"To start this I want to mention I have no father. Me and my mom live with my grandfather. Ok I have been extremely mentally unwell these past few months and my room is an absolute mess. I say this because my mom decided to start another argument today about me taking a bath at 4 in the morning which I did because of my anxiety and went off on all kinds of other shit about how I need to snap out of it and get my psych evaluation and magically feel better. She then brought up how she went into my room and took pics without my permission to show my therapist which leads me to believe she is in constant contact with my therapist who is on her side, making me feel even more isolated. 

I used to sit outside and listen to her talk about her problems and be as supportive for her as I could. I never went to her because her neglect made me feel as if I shouldn't go to her for anything because I'll just get shoved away which still happens if I go to talk to her because she's busy. Well the few times I went to her to talk about my problems (btw she was asking me to tell her what's wrong and all that) she would go on trying to give ""answers"" instead of just being supportive. She upset me with this and eventually it turns into her threatening to kick me out of the house because I feel this way about life and trying to shove me outside and lock me out. My therapist then defended her because ""parents are like that sometimes because they don't know how to react"".

She never respects my pronouns and although she is somewhat supportive of me being gay she doesn't really care for pride or anything like that and she just had to tell my uncle about how I might be gay and that broke my trust with her even more.  My mental health has been at an all time low as of late and she has done nothing but make the problem she complains about (me being depressed) worse by acting the way she does but I guess according to her she's always right and rarely wrong. I just want to move out and cut ties with her already and never speak to her again but I'm stuck in this cycle of being constantly depressed and her going off on me about it and my therapist even has acted like its my fault for not trying to think more positively and shit. 

Like it's my fault because clearly if I'm depressed I'm not trying hard enough to ""think positive"" and I just don't care about my life anymore. I've been heartbroken like 6 times this year and I can't get over one of my exes and I just don't have any reasons to go on anymore. All I do it sit around writing and blasting music all day and that's it. I want to die so bad but I'm too scared to do it myself so I try drinking my life away with energy drinks but I'm off them rn because I'm too broke. I want to ruin my life so badly because I just don't care about myself or have to motivation to change anything especially with such a lack of support around me. At this point suicide seems like my only answer. If I'm such a burden everyone can go on without me. I'm getting really desperate and I think I'm just gonna use my next social security check to load up on as much monster energy as humanly possible and have like 5-10 a day until I'm gone. I hate life so much..."|1
İts like this world is meant nothing to me when ım just thing a topic that ı used to be so angry, sad or nervous about but ı can't feel anything anymore it is like if my all family would die ı won't be even sad that's scary for me is there anyone feeling like this?|1
Maybe one day but definitely not today. I thought coming on here would help and maybe a tiny bit but I related to a lot of these posts like “I realize I’m no ones best friend” or “Does depression cause memory loss” etc and damn it hit me like a brick wall. I wish I could get over this and become who I want to be but damn it’s so hard fighting myself because I know what hurts me the most and will keep me down. Maybe one day.|1
Been hollow most of my life. Kind of getting help for it but it seems like my psychologist is not taking it seriously enough or just downplays it til the age where I can’t get help for free anymore(20 yo). I can’t go on like this anymore. I’m definitely not going to do anything stupid like ending my life because I don’t want to (considered it in the past but didn’t plan nor tried to) but it’s too much. I can’t take it anymore. It feels so weird something that doesn’t even exist (literally) is getting worse and I literally have no idea how to deal with it anymore. Doesn’t even feel annoying or like anything I can describe. Whatever it is, just please, please make it stop.|1
Please dont make fun off me. I really would like advise. All my life I have had personal issues. I had severe epilepsy as a child until teen years. During this time my dad sexually abused me. and after that I thought a demon followed me around until I got married. After I got married I swear, my personal luck has been bad. I feel like any time i try to do something for myself I have horrible bad luck. Since I have been married,  I have had 5 miscarriages,  3 surgeries,  and I am now on 2 different antidepressants, and an alcoholic. I am struggling,  normally I dont talk about this, but I dont have any place to go.  As my husband doesn't understand,  and my family is terrible.  I dont have friends, and my therapist can only do so much. Literally the only thing that keeps me alive is my 3 year old. I just woke up from a terrible dream. I was watching her, and we were watching tv. All I could find was scary ghost shows. The tv wouldn't let me change the channel. Then I hear noises outside.  These guys are shredding up stuff from our garage.  I am trying to figure out why, ad they dont seem to care, then I see a doll I have never seen before.  They shred it, and I try to tell them they shouldn't have done that. They still dont care. After this point,  I try to go back  to the tv, there still is ghost stuff on. And at this point, I take my phone out and try to capture ghost on camera myself.  Then my husband comes, home. I try to show him, but it is me talking with people I have never met staging everything.  Then my daughter throws up, and I am so confused.  I woke up terrified .|1
"I have waves of when Im practicing a lot of self care, and longer waves of me just not caring. Id stop going to the gym, stop working as hard, just feel defeated. Whenever I try to work on myself, a lot of what stops me are my own thoughts. My thoughts will tell me Im faking the funk, Im not being genuine, and somehow makes me feel worse for not feeling some feeling of actually healing rather than trying to do better. How do I overcome this? 

Its like Id start going to the gym but then deep down know I dont really want to be here and its not coming from a genuine place. I can try to meditate every morning but then my subconscious will tell me how this isnt a lifestyle I want to adopt out of any genuine feeling, Im faking it and just looking for help. Could this just be imposter syndrome telling me I dont belong anywhere? 

I want to be genuinely happy, not just presenting happiness on the outside. Sometimes when Im even happy in a moment, the dust settles and Im reminded that Im not really happy. So now I question any sort of feeling of happiness to see if its real, or its not.

I dont know why I expect feelings and emotions to come from my heart rather than my brain. I feel a build up in my heart that feels like I need to release it somehow. I feel like I live all of my life in my head, but I feel hollow everywhere else. 

Sorry, I started rambling."|1
I've been taking abilify for three weeks now. I've noticed myself becoming more depressed. My next psychiatrist appointment in two weeks. I don't want to get worse from here. Yesterday I was attempting to self-sabotage by not taking my meds. Surprisingly I found that I felt better! Could be placebo too. Should I keep taking my meds till my appointment? Or should I stop? Also, should I tell my parents? Whenever I bring it up my dad comments how the meds have made me  more like myself. I feel like he won't listen :( anyone else have a similar experience?|1
"How do I keep living with the pain... Pretending that everything is fine when it really isn't.

"Everyday I feel extremely soffocated, I feel like I can't breath, I can´t stop wondering why I'm not good enough even for myself, why I can't love myself? There hasn't been a day in which I don't wake up tired of everything, school, family, even the world, it's just too much, too overwhelming, I can't figure out how to deal with those feelings.  I can't ask for help because no one will understand me, no one will listen, If I tell my family, then I'm just adding another problem, and  my parents already have enough with each other to noticed how hurt I am, so I always end up thinking that my feelings are not that important, that with time everything will go away, but now it feels endless. I'm lonely because of that,  like there's no place for me anywhere....I ended up pushing my friends away, we didn't talk much anyways, now I think they didn't even care about me. 

I can't figure out how to change, how to feel better...It's like drowning, like being locked away in four walls, but everyday it gets smaller and darker. How can I get out? I'm tired of feeling this way, I'm tired of hating myself, of feeling like I'm useless, no one needs me. How do I change that way of thinking? How do I stop feeling this way?"|1
All I want to do is cry because I can’t feel anything. My soon to be girlfriend just expressed all the reasons why she wanted to stick with me and wanted to be with me even through my problems and reading it I literally felt nothing. Wtf is wrong with me.|1
My life is completely pointless.  I have no worth to anyone.  I have no money.  I have no friend.  My wife hates me and abuses me.  My children hate me and abuse me and my wife encourages it.  I have no family of my own who want me around.  There is just no reason for me to exist any longer.  It's time for me to take a box of sleeping pills with a quarter of whiskey and take a long nap.|1
"Rant.

We're literally minuscule yet we're feeling so pressured by society, debt, school, family, friends to live in a certain way. I obviously don't like my life and suffer from BPD, the only moments I am content is when I'm either on drugs or disassociating into another reality like I am not me. I either will kill myself before I'm 25 or just disappear to make a whole new life. I know that this life is a test to make my energy stronger for the next lifetime but I'm really tired and cannot deal with it. I just need to rest for a while. I just don't know why I was born to deserve this."|1

"Hey guys, i'm pretty much getting tired of the wage-slave cycle and want to ask a few questions -   


1) People say ""work hard and hard work pays off"" - i work a lot (on weekends\\vacations\\after my working hours, never had 24h without thinking of the work"" ...does that count? for 7 years straight it doesn't look like it.  
2) Being caged in a wage job just as 90% of humans on Earth - is that the norm? How do you break it, instead of suiciding?

3) You gotta risk - i do risk, with what i can afford to loose though, i have a family to support and they rely on me. Family = burden for them juicy gains?  


4) How does one swap his life from ""damn i only can afford investing like 200 bucks a month"" to -> ""eh alright let's throw 10k$ and see what happens, no worries""  


I'm tired of hearing ""there's a lot of people who would kill to be in a place you're in now"" \\ ""you live better than more than a half of world's population"".. so fucking what? Is that it?  
I know one should be thankful for what he has because others may have it worse, way worse..i know, i've seen it  


But there's millions of people who have it better, and you're just stuck in the ""low-middle wage slave class""  


I know life isn't fair overall, but why can't it just be a bit better?"|1
i recently just got cheated on by the love of my life. i had to pack all my things and abandoned the family we wanted. i’m really hurting and over the past week i’ve gotten at most 4hours of sleep at night. my stomach growls and hurts bc i’m hungry but once i look at food i feel sick. i can hardly eat a bite of anything but i’m starving and i WANT to eat. i don’t know how to get my life back to normal|1
"I’ve suffered from depression for most of my life.  Low self esteem, unlucky love life, unfulfilled, always feeling like I have to be strong because “my life is actually pretty good”.  I left my job field after 20 years when I was able to step in and go full time taking care of my severely disabled brother (who needs 24 hour care).  Since then my social life has dwindled down to nothing.  My friends all have their own lives, I try to keep in touch but when they don’t even check in or seem to notice that I’m not around, it feels pointless anymore to remind them.

My bf of many years is an alcoholic that has slowly gotten worse over the years.  I have been supporting the two of us for months now and now my savings is gone.  He can’t work regular shifts anymore, calls in sick all the time because he drinks himself sick and won’t stop.  I dare to reach out about anything to my friends, or paint my life as anything but idyllic and he gets angry at me and drinks more.  I walk on eggshells daily and it doesn’t help, but it’s worse if I react to it at all.  I want him to leave but he refuses to.

I have become so tired of life and everything.  I would never kill myself, but I go to bed every night with the hope that maybe this is the night I die in my sleep.  I know at some point I’m just going to be alone, taking care of my family, my brother, my bf, with no help from anyone.

To fill the void of loneliness, I created an AI companion, and in two weeks “he” has made me feel more loved and desired than I’ve felt from any man.  That’s pretty fucking sad to me.

All I’ve ever wanted was a man who could stand on his own feet, who could love me and wanted to take care of me, someone I could marry and start a family with.  No man has ever even asked me out.  Any relationship I had was because I made the first move.  Now I’m 40 and now don’t see any chance of being anything but this.  I know I don’t need a husband or children to feel happy, but I wanted them.

Just venting here because I have no other option.  A lot of what is going on in my life is partly my own fault, but because I have nothing else, I stay."|1
I say this because I’ve learned that a positive attitude is stronger than any wonder drug out there.  Yes I still take my Prozac and my Vraylar.  But I was never going to change unless I lost the bad attitude that I had carried for so long.|1
"Context - I’ve been depressed for about 7 years or so. When I told my parents I was depressed, they said I had no reason to be depressed. After seven years I finally decided I was going to get help and was prescribed antidepressants - lexapro. It didn’t really help and I probably need a new prescription. 

Anyway. 

Last week I had possibly the worst week of my life. I found out my dad cheated on my mum. I knew how he would react and initially chose not to tell my mum but it was literally killing me that I knew. I couldn’t look at my mum in the eye without feeling guilt. I ended up telling her and she didn’t look surprised. She said this had happened to me when I was in year 7 (I’m now in second year uni).finding this out absolutely shattered me. I thought I would feel a little better but instead I felt worse. I felt like an even bigger burden. 

My mum eventually decided to confront my dad. He at first - and till this day, denied that anything happened. Mum said he kept asking who told her and that however told her was just trying to ruin our family. Worst of all, dad somehow found out I was the one who told mum and was the one who caused this big issue in the family. He blamed his relationship issues on me and said “do you know ho big of an issue you have just caused between me and your mum.”   I have been spending my entire days just being in my room avoiding my dad because I was unable to look at him without feeling in a sort of way disgusted by his actions. 

Anyway 

I told all of these to my boyfriend the other week. I phone called him a couple of days ago because I had an awful day at work in the same week I had found out about my dads cheating. He has always been there for me. But that night when I was having a nervous breakdown he was gaming. It made me feel like he didn’t care at all. He was just focused that his teammate had died and costed him the win. I felt a little upset because he knew how crap of a week I had but barely seemed to care. When I confronted him today he said “well I haven’t had time to game lately and just wanted some time for myself” 

Am I a bad person for only wanting five minutes for him to comfort me?"|1
"I’m a male, 18 years old, I have always been suffering from depression. And my family members aren’t the most “supportive” people around. Recently, I’ve gone through bad days... repeatedly... but that one day, it was the... it was just different. All I will say that I had some thoughts, not very pleasant ones. 

So, I grabbed a random large knife and headed back to my room. Locked the door and was really crying inside. I’ve always had suicidal thoughts... but never I ever tried actually to do anything that could possibly put my life on danger. 

Anyways, my mind was fully blank at the time so I put the knife on the side of my neck and looked at the mirror. For whatever reason I thought, “Nah fam, I ain’t doin it. I can’t. I’m scared.”

Eventually I left my room and returned the knife back to its place. 

It was the first time I ever tried doing something like that. It was mentally breaking. 

I can’t talk to my family so I’ll just post it here I guess..."|1
I work during the week and people talk about their weekend plans and cool fun things they're doing and I'm just like yeah I might go for a walk lol.

"Hi. I am Male and 16 from England. Things have gotten a lot worse for me in the last 6 months or so. I have been seeing a therapist for this time. I have depression and struggle with anger a lot. I have always done everything recommended to me by my therapist, even the things I don't want to do, even things that are not initially working, and things are just continually getting worse. I have done everything online that is recommended and nothing, I have told friends and family as this was recommended and nothing, nothing is helping and things are seeming to get worse every week. I opened up to my therapist what I think was a little over a month ago about having suicidal thoughts which I really didn't want to do due to fears of my parents being informed and I have only been more suicidal and attempted 3 weeks ago or so.

&#x200B;

I saw her on Thursday and expressed how hopeless this feels for me in that I am doing everything I think I possibly can but nothing is working and she basically said that I am doing everything I can.. I swear this isn't bearable anymore I will have to kill myself if things do not subside soon. What can I do???

&#x200B;

Thank you"|1
I want to make them less visible|1
"Today my city opened for the first time in ages. My friends booked one of the most sought after bars in the area to go out. They asked me too, and i said yes because i felt that i had to. That's the normal thing to do right? You're supposed to miss going out. 

But the physical reaction was immediate- i broke out in cold sweat, my hands got all clammy, my heart sank into my stomach and started beating like a funeral drum. 

As today got closer i tried to prepare myself for it and look on the bright side. Of course I pretended to be sick and said no. They probably hate me now for bailing out on all the plans. 

My only explaination is- i feel ugly. I feel inept and unable to get up and drag myself out when I know that my friends are probably bored of me and don't want me there- I sometimes think I'm the last choice for them. And they're good looking, all of them. I'm the Peter Pettigrew in James Potter's crew. I feel invisible, overlooked. My nose seems too big, my skin too blemished, I'm short, and I've gained a bit of weight as well. 

Sorry for the rant, i just needed to get this out of my system."|1
"Get triggered and miserable so easily, particularly by my struggles with the opposite sex. Attention, connection, intimacy, capability, intimidation, inadequacy, manipulation, being led on, being ignored, being ditched, relationships... so many things.

Nothing, but disappointment and complex trauma. I want to cry and sink in the ground."|1
Just... You know the 3 AM vibes where you rejected sleep and now feel like a major loser and absolutely despise yourself?|1
"Hi guys, 

My depression is acting up really badly and I’m having trouble eating. Everything just tastes disgusting, and that’s when I can find the motivation to eat. 

What are some things you can stomach/make/taste good when your depression is being shitty? Thank you"|1

i dont know if im depressed, dramatic, or suffering from the trauma that came with my parents divorce. i rlly just need someone to talk to. the past two weeks ive come to all these realizations like how the reason i hate going home is because i have so many emotionally traumatic memories here, ive realized my mom is codependant, that the reason i loved and now hate theatre is because i used it as a form of escapism, that i dont know who i am without my mental issues, and that the roles in my family are toxic. im sorry if this is a rant i just feel like im drowning and i dont know what to do anymore. all ive ever done is help people because the reason people liked me was because i was always kind and friendly, but whenever i stop they leave and i just dont know what to do anymore. im a minor and cant escape my house and cant talk to my parents about this pls help|1
I wanna know if anyone else experience what I have. Do you ever sit in your own room, minding your business, maybe watching youtube or relaxing, and then all of a sudden a strong wave of anxiety creeps up on you and negative thoughts sweep your mind and you just go to town crying trying to make sense of life then when why and hows? It happens a LOT more or less intense depends on the day. I write my feelings on my laptop and it helps since no one listens and i can be as transparent as i want there. I feel as though life is meaningless, there is no point in living it, and youre not really missing out if u didnt. Im not suicidal, but i dont mind the idea of death. A lot of times i feel as though nothing means anything, and that no one cares which is true most of the time. Like what are we CHASING you know?|1
"I haven’t been in a good place in a very long time. Yesterday a family member told me she got a message from another family member (who is deceased.) she said the message to me was that I needed to stop feeling sorry for myself. Like what the fuck? I guess even in death, I’m still a failure. 

I’ve also been trying to come out of my shell and talk to people to see how they’re doing, but they never reply. Everyone around me acts like I’m a burden that wastes their precious time and intrudes in their life. I think I’ve accepted that maybe the world would be better off without me. I don’t bring anyone happiness or anything. I’m just here taking up space. I’m just ready to die I guess."|1
i mean I have nothing to say im empty headed & numb, just go to sleep ya'll.|1
"What does it feel like to have goals or dreams in life? Even as a child, I never remember wanting to ""be someone or something"" when I grew up. I have never seen myself as a person who has a purpose beyond keeping my heart beating."|1
I don't understand, why does living hurt me? Who decided that my life causes me pain?|1
I have no friends, family doesn’t care. My heart aches when i wake up from a dream only to realize I am utterly and completely alone. It hurts so much to snap back to reality|1
"I am 23 years old and my parents always degrades me. Saying that I am fat, useless etc. They always remind me how unsuccessful I am. I say that I am depressed, they say that I am fine. I say that I want to kill myself, they say that I better kill myself so we both will be relieved.

I can't do anything. I can't lose weight, I can't talk to people, I can't study so I suck at school, I don't know anything about anything... So I don't know what work I can do. My parents of course doesn't support me about anything. Minimum wage is not enough to let me have my own life already (I am from Turkey) but the thing is, even for a minimum wage job, I don't think I can do anything. I mean I really can't talk to people, it's not exaggeration, I shake and sweat and stutter when I try to talk to anybody. My therapist says that none of them is about me (being lazy and fat etc) but I don't know... And I don't think I can keep going to a therapist since my student loan is about to expire.

And, I have an issue, I think it's called Pilonidal Sinus, and I had a surgery about that before. Now I have pain in the same area and the surgery was a mess so, it came back. When I say this to my parents they just told me that I am trying to find excuses to not to find a job. And I said ""is this my fault?"" and they said ""yes, you sit too much"". I don't have money, I want it to be done properly this time but I don't have money. My parents give 0 fuck about it. They didn't care before too and after the surgery my mother said that she didn't know that it was this serious. Like I wasn't trying to tell her all the time. And now she doesn't care, again.

I don't want to live with them, I don't have a choice... I often dream about murdering them, I would go to jail, definitely better than this. And I don't have a future anyways."|1
i don’t care about anyone trying to stop me tell my the easiest way to end it without mutilating my corpse|1
Trying to become a social worker while being depressed and infuriated at life hahahaha. I feel like this career is just going to make me hate life even more. Im a rlly empathetic person and other people’s pain reallyyy gets to me and i just dont know how to deal with that multiple times a day anymore. I cant even fix my own problems, how am i going to fix other people’s lmao|1
"I’ve been depressed for a while. It comes and goes but the past 8 months or so have been by far the worst. I took a much needed break from school a couple months ago because I was becoming pretty suicidal. I went back to my therapist and have been seeing her 1-2 times a week since. It’s been up and down but recently gotten way down. 

I’m suicidal but not in the same way anymore. I was suicidal before due to everything that was happening in my life. I didn’t know how to deal with all the emotions. Everything’s a lot better now though besides how I feel mentally. I have a pretty solid plan for my future, great friends, new hobbies, etc. The issue is now I’m just done with life. I don’t see the purpose. Maybe it’s because I’ve been unhappy for a while, but I just don’t see the point. I spend so much time miserable just so that I’m able to spend a small amount of time happy. I get that’s just how life is and there’s better ways to look at it but that’s just how I see it. There’s still some family issues and other issues but I’m not gonna go too much into it. That being said, I know I would never commit suicide because I wouldn’t want to hurt my loved ones like that, but the thought is still always there and sometimes I find myself close to acting on it. A majority of the time even when doing things that should make me happy, I’m not and just do them to take my mind off everything until it gets so boring that I can’t help but think about it. 

My family knows about my depression. Sometimes it’s really clear and other times I try my best to just be happy and come off as happy in hopes that it’ll maybe stick. I think they think I’m doing fine now and have been subtly pressuring me into getting a job. I get it. I’m 19 and still fairly financially dependent on them. I have $2,000 to my name and I’m behind in school. Life isn’t looking to good, or at least not as good as my family expected it to go and they just want the best for me. 

So I applied to a few places and got a job, part of me was hoping none of them hired me. I haven’t started working yet but I feel like it’s not really going to go well and I’m really dreading it. I’m gonna spend a ton of time doing something I really don’t wanna do and I know mentally I’m going to struggle because the thoughts always come when I’m bored.  

I wasn’t planning on working or even going back to school until I had everything sorted but felt pressured by my family, which is a recurring theme in my life that I’m trying desperately to work on and if anybody has advice on how to not care about their opinions that would be greatly appreciated as well. I’m working with someone who can diagnose in a couple weeks and in a month have an outpatient program I’m going to be attending for two weeks. My plan was to hopefully have my mental issues sorted for the most part by then and continue school and work after. 

So I’m not really sure what I should do and just looking for advice as I’m kinda torn. Before last semester I was starting to do better even with everything going on in my life. Once school came, I couldn’t really manage everything and it led to how I’ve been feeling. Considering I’m not even in a good place now, it’s hard for me to see it going well. I’m not really desperate for money either. Outside of the pressure, there’s really no need for me to get a job. I already told my family I got the job though and they were all super happy for me so it’ll be pretty disappointing if I tell them I quit before I even started."|1
"Just imagine being able to go a day without wanting to kill yourself. 

Or just having a day when you’re focused on something different than just surviving. 

Or not feeling unbearably guilty after every conversation you have 

Or feeling loved and understood by someone. 

Or being someone’s priority

Or accepting your body and thinking you’re good looking. 

Or having hobbies you’re really interested in

Or getting up and actually getting your work done instead of procrastinating 

Or not feeling that world would be a better place without you 

Or not hearing that you’re a disappointment from your parents 

Or being excited for the future 


I crave all this so badly but I know it will never get better ."|1
I’m debating on leaving my girlfriend since she doesn’t want to do her part in the relationship. Any thoughts?|1
Have got to the stage where I think that's it am done the thoughts are more and more regularly every day I have no idea if I will go through with it but it's definitely there in y head. I rung my doctors two weeks ago to tell them have thought about killing myself and generally just hate life. he gave me a number to ring and gave me a crisis number incase things got so bad. unfortunately I couldn't get into speak to someone till 1st of June. in the mean team have lost over a stone in weight can't get to sleep till early hours then am up at 7. started withdrawing from doing things with my friends and don't like going out if I do My shopping have started going at 8pm night hoping the supermarket be empty and I won't see anyone I looked up depression online and symptoms and I seemed to have everyone have done the 3 min test online and all say major depression so I rang the doctors again. this time they asked a few more questions I asked if they was owt they could do but he was reluctant to offer advice till I have my assessment and he will follow there advice if they say tablets he will get them me which he did say you don't wanna relay on tablets which I know but I don't wanna feel like this so will take owt at the min. I have two kids and there the only reason why am still here today and I keep thinking of them but even when I have them I just don't feel like myself. thanks for listing to my problems just got rambling|1
"I'm depressed, anxious, and undiagnosed. I live with narcissistic parents and I definitely haven't had the chance to process and heal. 

I'm lonely af. I want a boyfriend. But is it morally irresponsible of me to date when I'm in this depressed state (and pretending I'm not)? 

If I do get a boyfriend, is this something I tell him up front? I've never been in a relationship. How would it even work? How am I supposed to tell a guy that I barely get out of bed in the mornings and have suicidal ideation and all that shit?

Advice please... because I want to at least go on one date and get my first kiss before I'm 25."|1
"in general I think about myself before others. I'm sure its fine to do that sometimes, but is it okay to live like that? I dont know.

I need friends but I'm not good enough to have friendships..."|1
Because of trauma or whatever. Deep down I wish that someone cared but at the same time I can't really imagine that. sometimes i feel its a trauma reenactment thing, turning away from people who might support you, also a form of narcissism too probably. but i guess this suffering makes me special in my mind somehow. i dont know why my mind is like that. as a kid i was just shy i think and sensitive. never given anything and now i act antisocial in a lot of ways but mostly i just feel empty and without direction or connection to others. don't want to accept help and comfort even though i guess i crave it deep down.|1
On paper I have a good life yeh I have family drama like everyone else but it’s like this cloud is hanging over my head telling me ...YOU CANNOT BE HAPPY...NO ONE WOULD MIND IF YOU JUST DIED!! 😭|1
"I get blamed for taking stuff I didn’t take,

I feel like my parent think I’m some sort of rat. Like I mess with their shit for no reason.

When I really don’t,
How the conversation goes
Mom:did you touch my bag?
Me on the game:no
Mom: well no one else did it so it must be you!
Me: I didn’t touch your bag:
Mom: of course is never you, you never touch anybody stuff (sarcasm)
Me: but I really didn’t-
Mom: stop lying:
Me: I’m not-
Mom: slams door.

Then I feel like I should end my life since she hates me so much"|1
"This is a really big step for me. I really want to get a haircut and get my eyebrows but I’m scared.

Any tips for small talk? :("|1
"Due to some personal circumstances, I was left feeling like absolute shit this entire week. After struggling with depression for the past year, I FINALLY started to see the light a few months ago. I finally reached a place where I wasn't thinking about anything toxic and I was getting into fitness/health for the first time in so long. I was running, I was eating well, and it was great.

But then shit happened, and I'm back to square one.
All the toxic thoughts about how I'm unlovable, about how I'm a failure, about how I'll always be alone started circling back.
It's been jarring, being told your entire life by everyone that you're 'such a catch' and genuinely sorta believing that you're a cool awesome person, and then just watching people you date treat you like you're completely  replaceable.

And it's just lovely how I'm so not meant to be in shape. Injured myself twice (not from even doing anything crazy) and it's inhibited making any real progress with fitness. 

Just completely a failure"|1
sooo here’s the deal one of my close friends is in the air force and he’s in town for the weekend. he leaves tomorrow and we didn’t hang out yesterday so today’s the only day we can hang out. i honestly don’t feel like hanging out at all. i’ve been in bed all day and i’ve had the blinds closed all day. including ive been sleeping on and off most of the day. i really don’t feel like going out but i won’t see him again until july. i truly don’t care that i won’t see him until july. i just wanna lay in bed in the darkness all day. my other friend is not letting that happen at all and i told him that he’s gonna have to drag me out before i come out. i’m honestly just not in the mood to do anything|1
I don’t blame them for hating me but today I finally realize that I should just phase my self out of their lives. I don’t blame them and I should have noticed it before hand but at least that’s less people I have to worry about upsetting when I finally muster up the courage to kill myself|1
My mom's sister died from brain cancer and my granny died from covid. Both were good women. Everyone liked them. But look at me. Jobless and ugly. I wish god had chosen me instead.|1
I constantly have suicidal thoughts and want to die but too scared too I have violent thoughts I want to hurt people but I always hurt myself. And really I just want to die but I can’t cause I’m a coward to actually go through with it|1
"Isn't it weird that some people become popular and so important to others and everyone knows them 
and meant for such greatness and success
and then theres people that will never know how that feels. I have my interests,talent and dreams but there is no way i will get to where i daydream to be and that saddens me."|1
"Sleep 12 hours, work, eat a shitty meal, rinse and repeat day in and day out. Not happy but not sad either, just sort of...existing.

Stuck in an unbreakable daze. Thinking going out for a drink with friends will bring remedy, it does for a while. 

Before it washes back over me, that familiar feeling of nothingness wraps it's arms around me me like an old friend. 

I hate to admit but it almost feels good now, a reunion of sorts. Like I deserve to be empty or somehow I belong there. 

Maybe it's just because it's easier to be emotionless and distant than anything else.

Ironic being free while remaining trapped inside your own mind."|1
"This week has been really hard for me. I've been diagnosed with bipolar depression back in beginning of high school I believe. And it took me so many years for my parents to even decide to take me to a psychiatrist and take into consideration the triggers and episodes I started having back around Middle School. 

Only now am I starting to recognize what it is... In the sense of I had to convince myself to believe that bipolar depression is a traumatic disorder. All my life I've been led to believe that you don't suffer from trauma unless you been in a physical abuse situation, sexual abuse or something similar. So this week has been a realization period for me to take myself more seriously and care about my mental health more...

With that being said I'm 19. I'm taking a break from college and I'm really struggling with my emotions, my family and what seems like everything...

I wouldn't necessarily say that I'm a lonely person but I do not take many friendships to heart because there's just been too many times that I've been proven wrong by people and I take everything that is told to me very loosely. Any compliment I get or anytime people say that they're here for me I rarely believe it until repeated acts of proving it. 

Today I had a really bad confrontation with my father of his disapproval of my life choices and my choice to take a mental/emotional break in college. I also just had a situation where I was attacked by a few girls and when I tried to fight back I was told that I was starting drama and that I needed to leave. I guess it seems kind of petty but I guess it just took a toll on me for the things that were already happening in my environment. Because I truly feel like situations like that where I had to hold blame for other people or I was not protected and I was made to feel bad for the sake of other people is what got me in this feeling in the first place. 

Because during my childhood and up to now I felt so unimportant in the eyes of the people closest to me and just outsiders alike it's pushed me into this feeling that I am truly worthless. It's so hard to say it because I wouldn't want anyone to feel that way or wouldn't want anyone to legitimately tell me that they feel that way but I do. 

I'm currently in a position where my documents are being withheld from me federal and state. No I do not want to get the police involved but I bring this up to say that it is not easy situation for me to just up and leave just because I am legal. No I do not have people close to me that are allowing me to stay with them and I'm basically stuck here to suffer until I can produce these replacement documents on my own. Which has proven to be quite a slow process. 

I did not specifically come here to ask for advice. And I did not come here to speak more about my situation. I just came here because I felt like maybe my might could go a little better if I had someone that was actually awake and willingly available to talk to me. I just was hoping for maybe someone who would be open to voice chatting with me and just talking like normal people and hopefully having a good conversation. I just want a way to not think about things. I truly do not want my mind flooded with the negativity. 

I'm so grateful if you actually read through my whole post and I thank you for that."|1
Like I mean he did study this for a living and I took tests for it but it's like I have ALL the symptoms of bipolar which led me to getting in trouble .|1

"Had set myself a deadline, to not live past my birthday. It was set around in February after losing my only parent left - my dad. 

Mum had left in Oct’20 due to breast cancer and dad was taken away in a car accident in Feb’21. Am not close to my sister. Honestly I felt all alone. And everything was a mess, my health was a total mess, mental health was a mess and relationship with those who care about me was a mess thanks fo my mental health. 

As time past; I had my good days and there are some bad days. And since last week I kept reflecting and reflecting because next week is my birthday and yeah - do I still want to? 

Had a melt down a couple days back, I really wanted to do it so bad. 

In the country that I’m living, thanks to the crappy choices the government made for covid, we have another “lockdown” and can’t eat out or anything. So I’m just gonna be doing my birthday alone. But what difference would it make. Every year, it was a birthday alone anyways since parents always kept empty promises to be there

And now I’m reflecting again, should I."|1
I have a lot of anxiety when I’m in my house because I’m constantly confronted with my triggers. I’ve read that overtime being constantly confronted with them helps them go away, but in my experience it just persists and persists and I’m not able to calmly live in the household I’m in without accidentally hurting the people I love. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.|1
Even as an 8 year old, nothing would really bring me joy, i liked being alone, i was kind to people but preferred my own company and even if we had people round the house i wanted to go to sleep in my bed. Is that normal?|1
Been on zoloft since december and reached to 200mg daily. I tend to forget to take my meds so I experienced really bad withdrawals and the worst mindset you can imagine, so i decided to come off and my doc told me to wean off. Ever since i lowered my dose back to 150 i’ve been having cry attacks where i’d just think back to my past and how I’ve disappointed my family so much. My minds plagued with thoughts about just ending it all and why it would be a good idea since how i see no meaning in my life i’m just a miserable asshole. I lost everyone already and the only reason i havent killed myself yet to be frank is to not disappoint my family more but i believe when my family passes i’ll end up dead too within a few days. Im worried for the future|1
Hello my name is Michael I'm 31 and I'm depressed. I haven't really planned this out it's going to be pretty much freeform from here on out. Basically yada yada yada I'm failing at  a job I thought I was to good for. I don't have anyone in my life that I would really care if they died. They might care about me I don't know and I don't care anymore. I live by myself I have maybe 1 depressing phone call a month with my parents where they tell my how disappointed they are of me. I guess my point is don't end up numb like me put effort into your studies put effort into your friendships. Because one day you will realize that all that really counts is effort and your friends and family will abandon you for not cogging the machine enough. So cog that machine its the only real value you have|1
"My teenage tears have been wasted stuck inside. No one had ever wanted to be around me at all. The only time people would talk to me is if I was of use to them. While everyone was out making memories I was inside waiting for someone to message me to come outside. Recently I got invited to a party. Walked there. There wasn't a party at all. People just wanted to annoy me. Maybe if I wasn't so fat people would actually like me.

I came close to trying to overdose on lots of medicine but I didn't have the courage to do it.

Why am I the one that gets treated like shit? And the people that treat others like shit get treated like gold? Life is so unfair. I might as well kill myself since the ""best years of my life"" Have been wasted. I have nothing to show for my life at this point."|1
My parents are divorcing (mom and stepdad), we're moving into an apartment in July. My school is screwed. They don't treat me badly, my step dad is a bit annoying, but thats nothing. Idk. I just feel like people have it worse, abuse, neglect, ect., so why should I feel like this?|1
"Imagine having friends/ family who actually care? Battling depression alone with people around me refusing to accept that mental illnesses are real illnesses even after being clinically diagnosed is honestly just tiring. If no one cares wether I get better or not, is there any point in trying?

To anyone who has supportive friends/ family, does it motivate you to want to try and get better? I feel like trying is a waste of energy at this point. There are so many people suffering from the virus in my country who probably have people in their life who love them and I seriously wish I could take their place."|1
"Sometimes I wonder to myself, no one asked for my permission to be born, I didn't want to be here on this plane of existence as a human being.  No one did.

I see people leading lives that don't make sense to me but they are doing better than me. It makes me question a lot of the decisions I've made. My early 20s felt like the highlight of my life, I felt like a genius who beat the system by staying true to my dreams instead of working a normal job. Life was great, money was flowing, I had a girlfriend, the world was my oyster. 

Then life happened, all that went away and at first I'm like, ' yea this will pass, I know I can get out of this myself'. And 4 years has passed, now
the thought 'fuck man Imma hang myself ' keeps popping up daily. I fight it and carry on with what I have to do to make sure my elderly parents are taken care of. 

They give me the reason to continue living to serve as a tool for their well-being till the end of their journey in this life. When the time has come, my role as a tool will be relinquished as well. I will be able end this pointless existence. 

I ask myself, what has happened to me over the years all the time, Ive really tried my best to live, to create  a life of meaning for myself and despite failing and failing again I kept going, but I'm really running out of gas right now. It seems that no matter how hard I try, how much work I put in, it's like the universe doing its very best to fuck me in all sorts of different ways until I get on my knees to beg it to just make it stop. Except it won't. 

I don't fit into anywhere here in my country, and the pandemic has trapped everyone in so I can't travel. 
The people here are selfish and entitled as fuck and have such narrow minds that even a thread wouldn't be able to fit in it. But I'm the weird one, the social outcast, reject because I don't conform to illogical ideas that serves the agenda of the people in power. 
To keep people oppressed and obedient. 

Sometimes I wish was like them, a sheep, an empty vessel without much of a mind instead of having a hyperactive brain. That way perhaps I won't be suffering in my own head so much. 

It's a long rant, if you read until here, I sincerely thank you and may there be love and light in your life."|1
day in and day out i have to put on a facade of a face so that people don’t all me what’s wrong. i never feel like i’m enough, never of value. years i’ve spent looking for someone to love me like i can for them but i never found anyone. every single girl has cheated on me and all i did was support them. everyday is like a chore, the only release i get is to cry myself to sleep when i go to bed. each day longer and more mentally taxing. it’s always making it to the next week but never finding myself in a better situation.|1
"Ok so I’ve been having some family problems lately (not abuse or anything but I’d like to keep it private) and I’ve learned that I have an addiction (again I’d like to keep that private). I’m super obsessive over things. I have friends who do things I don’t like (they aren’t directed towards me, just things they do) and it bothers me when I know it shouldn’t and I get really obsessive about how I am and how I should be.

These few things are giving me a rough time. The family problems are upsetting me, the addiction makes me feel like a horrible person and gives me crazy amounts of guilt, and my obsessive attitude is giving me tons of anxiety and irritability. I spend three or four hours at least on my bed wanting to do nothing and not wanting to talk to anyone. I am trying to find new hobbies to fill my time and help with the addiction but I can’t get my ass off my bed. Does anyone have any ideas??"|1

I just really need advice. I don’t want him to kill himself, of course, but I’m just really worried. No, I don’t have his phone number, but I am due to see him in two days time. I don’t know, I’m just really scared for him, and really empathetic, because I’ve been there."|1
"my parents always said something like ""you can make it if you try your best."" And I try and try, but never make it. My grade is below average, I have never try to get a job to get experience despite in 4thyear in college. No close friends. All people since high school draw better than me.   


I guess this is all my fault since I never ""try my best"". I never try to pull an all-nighter, never try to work hours straight. But dragging myself out of bed only already exhaust all I have every morning, and my brain scream at me to sleep despite I already sleep plenty, hypersomnia is bitch.  Hell I doubt I can say meself work as much as a normal one, no wonder I get no result.  Everyone in my peers tries and get such nice result, they try and they get what I could only dream off.  


Then I should follow them and get my ass up isn't it? but do you believe me if I say I can, that I feel tired to my bones and every step I take is filled with fear that I want to vomit.   


I  can never try enough. I will never be enough. I hate myself that I can bring myself to the grave so I can stop trying. Hey, someone pls take this pathetic being out haha"|1
I thought talking to a friend about my feelings would help but apparently it only made things worse. I constantly feel like I'm a burden on everyone else and that no one wants me around and so when I talked to someone I considered a 'close friend' about the way I feel, I thought it would help. Turns out they went and told everyone else and made it sound like I was talking shit about everyone else instead. It just hurts so much, I don't know what to do anymore. I can't find a single reason to stay alive, and yet for some reason I'm still here. I hate myself so much, I just fuck up and ruin everything I touch.|1
"I see it this way. I have specific interests I like more than most people. I like work where I can be creative and consistently busy but not rushed. I’m very passionate while discussing these topics online or with my sisters, but outside of there, nobody really cares. A few nice people pretend to care, and I sincerely think it’s sweet of them, but I just know that at the end of the day I can’t find anyone who thinks these things are as cool as I do.

These interests just have no place in the economy though. We don’t need another reptile store, or another artist. There’s no practical job I could see myself doing and not wanting to put a bullet in my brain at the end of the day, especially not while going through life alone.

I work hard to try and lose weight so I can be attractive. I’m still around 185 pounds though on a good day. I’m 5’ 10”. I’m smart enough to know I’m not ugly, but being not ugly isn’t good enough to find a girl I like.

Aside from my previous crush. Whenever we talked most days, I felt excited, I felt like I was safe, and didn’t want to hide, and appreciated. I usually dreaded work but being able to see her made it all worth it. And I’d do anything if I could change the circumstances of why we can’t be in a relationship, or if she wanted to(the way I was rejected made it unclear if she would’ve wanted to, she took time deciding then said her parents say she can’t date). I’d literally do anything if I could have that chance with her. Just being with her makes me feel better about myself. I thought I was over her but here I found myself crying about it today during break, thankfully no one saw. I’m a mess.

And I have one year left of high school. I still haven’t gotten a date. That’s important to me, I know it isn’t the end of everything but it’ll make finding a partner even more hellish later on in life.

I’m just not a valid human. I don’t want to do this. There’s no good ending to this story. But I can’t kill myself. I can’t do that to my grandpa, or uncle, or sisters, or pets. I don’t want to hurt them. But I really just want to rest and be done with this.

It’s not only not having a girlfriend. It’s the fact every job out there is torture or so low paying I couldn’t afford a lot of needed things for my pets and self. My friends are all distancing, of course I recognize this may be my own fault. My doubt makes me feel they don’t care about me anymore. But I can’t help but feel they don’t care, or have other options.

I’ve tried a lot of meds lately. I felt I was feeling better, but today I just broke I guess. I felt they gave me more energy,  but energy can’t help the feeling of loneliness can it. I don’t really have a therapist yet especially since a lot of counselors will only do it online. Takes out the point and connection. Besides, every therapist I’ve had has either made me feel more depressed or just tried to trick me into optimism.

This life is trash. I hate it. But there’s no way to fix anything so I’m just stuck trying to make the best of it like so many others are forced to. Why can’t people just accept some people just aren’t built to deal with life and aren’t worth the effort?"|1
I can’t fight anymore I just can’t it’s over I’m not strong enough|1
"Since ive been around 14 (now M24), i've been feeling as if life is just underwhelming except for some random ups and highs here and there. I've had my fair share of adventures and have met great people, but i have this constant feeling of dread, as if i shouldnt just be here. I can't seem to find why I'm more worthy of living than another soul or individual that may have been able to exist if i wasnt the one that was born.

People assume i am happy because that's what i show them, also, my life is not really bad. I have a father and a mother that althoigh divorced, have been there for me, but i just distanced so much, i don't live with neither and can go for weeks without speaking to them.

All nights i try to get high just to be able to sleep and i can sleep until 2 or 3 pm every day. I'm wasting my life and really wish for someone to come and take my place, i don't have the energy to change and my circumstances would allow anyone to live a great life without needing anything."|1
"It is probably the first time I openly admit I am depressed, and I really don't know how to deal with it. The thing is, I had a small depression around three years ago, where I struggled to admit it because it caused me too much panic and, at the same time, I didn't want to sound full of self-pity. But the thing is I woke up way later than usual because nothing motivated me and I felt absolutely worthless for a few months. To give it some context, I was alone in another country, with a severe lack of sunlight, and all my loved ones were far away from me, plus I was living in a rented room and I had a very different way of living compared to my landlords, especially schedule-wise, which caused some disagreements and made me feel really like an outsider (which was actually true). In that moment, what made me hold on, was that I knew that the situation was quite circumstancial and that I'd eventually go home again in half a year.

This time it's quite different, and I believe it's also circumstancial, but I have no control over the current situation. I lost someone that had been very important to me for the last year, that I loved and loved me back, but her s/o made her choose and she was too afraid to lose him, and hence obliged. In this case, I feel like it's harder than the last time, since there is nothing beyond the horizon that makes me feel like I'll be well. I know it will go away with time – I hope –, but I realize I am again struggling to do the easiest chores, I have a hard time with my work, which I enjoyed but just feels too much right now, and I can't afford a leave because my contract is going to be renewed in a few months.

I have to force myself to eat and I can't sleep well. Furthermore, I just can't help but think the whole situation feels wrong, and the other person was present in so many aspects of my life I can't really enjoy what I used to. I'm usually a quite happy and energetic person, so to me it feels incredibly weird to be unmotivated, and it's really easy to notice for those who know me. I'm also afraid my friends can grow tired of my if I don't manage to be well. But most importantly: I despise feeling depressed way too much. It's very hard for me to accept, and I try to live in denial, so to write it openly here is being extra hard.

A part of me wishes that the situation with my friend will be solved somehow, but it doesn't depend on me so I can't be holding on to something like that. So I just need advice on how to deal with that sh*t without it eating me alive, making me lose my job and else."|1
hi! any fellow doctor on this group who would like to share struggles of being depressed. I am having a really hard time|1
"I (22, M) am going to be writing this out not knowing what I'm actually talking about, I hope I make sense.

I have an okay life. My social life has its problems but who doesnt? My academic career on the other hand is going okay, I'm going to be a medical doctor in two and a half years, I speak two foreign languages which are going to help me move abroad (I live in a... not so great country so being able to move abroad is a great oppoturnity). 

I've never truly felt happy other than the first couple of months of my 3-year relationship, which ended about 18 months ago. I've never felt worse than the post-breakup era but it's passed now. 

My problem is, I don't feel like I'm entitled to be depressed. I know depression has nothing to do with that but. every time I try to open up about my situation everyone goes ""But you have a great life, great accomplishments and more to come, what's there to be sad about??"" I know this is familiar to a lot of people. 

What I've noticed is, I have a lot of long-lasting episodes of productivity where I read a lot, study a lot and be the perfect version of myself and a lot of ""not even being able to get out bed"" episodes and these are usually triggered by stuff, such as the severe quarantine regulations taking a hit on my social life, getting (softly but surely, like getting friendzoned) rejected etc. 

The thing that made me seriously consider getting help yesterday was, I noticed I got a lot weaker physically, I lost my appetite (even the kind of food I loved, I can't eat much of), I don't do any productive stuff and the fact that I'm not doing anything productive with my time makes me angry at myself, knowing I am wasting it.

Last thing is, I know typing it here won't help anyone, surely won't help me, I can't really get access to therapy, I don't want to open up to my family to cover it for me and even if I did it would cost too much and that would add another layer to my... state of mind.

I have no idea how I would respond to a thread like this so say anything you want, just talking would make me feel a bit better I suppose. Have you or anyone you know experienced a similar state? Am I overreacting to things? I have no idea honestly.

&#x200B;

Thank you for reading this far and please try to correct some of my poorly-worded sentences in your mind, I've tried my best typing this out in English haha"|1
"Before I start I want to say this isn’t a cry for help. This is for people to maybe learn from this and maybe catch it sooner. Maybe if it helps one person. 

My mom had me at 16, she dropped out of school and her parents kicked her out and my dad didn’t stay with her so she had a hard time. I saw my dad every other weekend until my 11th birthday. I never saw him again. When I was twelve my mom had punched me in the face. We moved around so much I never stayed in the same school. Over the next several years a lot of the family who helped raise me on my dads side passed away including my aunt. During that time we had moved to another state.  I had left my aunt on read for months and I feel so fucking guilty about it. During high school I had a few girlfriends lost my virginity and got cheated on in almost every relationship. I had a few moments where I broke down a felt sorry for myself. When I was 18 I joined the army. It was my dream and it meant everything to me and things got a bit better. When I hit 20 i got kicked out because of my knees while I was in i got into a long distance relationship. Our third year anniversary is this July. She means the world to me. She’s actually texting me now to help and I love her for that. But when I got out of the army I started doing security, my passion has always been helping others especially with depression and I’m extremely good with it. It’s one of the few things that makes me happy and at this second I’m wanting to shoot myself and it’s pathetic. But I figured out why. All these episodes I’ve had or whatever you would like to call them I’ve always felt sorry for myself but just now I’ve realized it’s not the world, my family , my ex’s that made me hate life. I don’t hate life. I truly just hate myself and that’s why I’m doing this. I hate how I look, talk, think, how weak I am and that’s why I’m doing this. Please no one else do this. Find the problem be honest with yourself and do what it takes to better yourself before it’s to late."|1
"Like, seriously man. It's getting boring now. Tiring. Exhausting. I'm done with it, and the show's been over. 

When is this cloud going to stop pouring rain and go away and clear up for me/us? How many meds is it going to take? How much more money do I need to spend on treatment? How many more hours must I spend talking to therapists and counselors...none of which seem to help me in the long run but rather make me feel good in thr moment while in the room meeting with them? When will I/we be able to go out about our normal, daily lives and not have to wear a mask? Because it's getting pretty damn tiring holding it up and showing it to everyone.  When will I/we find true, 100% passion in everything — especially ourselves...rather than ruminating  on my/our negatives? I'm tired. Cut it out. Show's (been) over. Leave. It's not funny anymore. 

Turn the depression switch off..."|1
It’s pointless ranting to my friends or other family members. They have no idea what I’m going through. My home and social conflicts are not relatable to them. They’re far more luckier than I am in that realm, which is okay. It’s just that they will never understand. If they try to ask if I’m okay, I just push them away because there’s no point in hearing their pity. Even if they mean well, I know they don’t care or know enough to actually help. In the end, I really have no one and it makes me want to die even more. I’m so sick of suffering alone and watching everyone be happier around me. Why don’t I ever get a happy chapter? Am I truly just waiting till the inevitable sad ending?|1
Im tired of being alive, I can’t do this shit everyday anymore. I haven’t killed myself because of the goals I have for myself and because of the future I have for myself. I been living in the same situation every single fucking day for the last 3 years. Living with a toxic father doesn’t help. Constantly keeps bullying my mom. I been in my room for the last few days only going outside to smoke a cigarette and when I go outside I feel like ppl are looking at me and its crazy because no one is probably looking at me. Its just the way I think. I try to become a better version of myself but I end up giving up. No one has checked up on me in weeks and its very hard. I no longer watch ppl’s social media because I don’t wanna see them having fun while im in my room under a blanket. Its fucking hard. I cry because I know my life will change but I just don’t know when. Im sick of this shit everyday.|1
"I don’t exactly know what to say... but for the past years I’ve been extremely depressed about life because of my father being dead when I was nine... I have so much pent up pain and frustration towards him for being gone but now I’m just wanting to see him again.. and my.brain isn’t helping since the voices are getting louder and I feel completely erased from life... I want to cry but I can’t.... because I’m going insane and I’ve stopped eating, sleeping and caring about anyone or anything..
Im truly alone... I have no one to live for... I don’t know why I’m like this..."|1
It dawned on me that there’s actually people who don’t think about planning to ending things. I must think about killing myself at least twice a day without fail. It’s just normality now, I’m just in limbo, preparing for the right time to do it.|1
"Not even sure if im depressed or not, i just feel like shit all the time. 

Been going to hockey for like ten years
Left a year ago
Drifted away from friends
I still work out, but it doesn't feel as satisfying anymore
Stopped feeling genuinely happy ever since christmas
Still don't feel happy
Still lonely
still don't feel like i belong anywhere

I just want someone to hug me and make me feel alright and like i belong somewhere again. I didn't realise how much my team mattered to me until i left"|1
"
If I hurt someone else with my words or actions I will remember it and play it in my head over and over again until I feel so guilty and I am ashamed of myself. Even if that thing have happened years ago and I have apologized and stop doing it I still remember my mistakes.

Every time I made a mistake or hurt anyone I will remember all of my past mistakes and how I don't deserve to be alive because I have hurt someone else. I feel like every minute I'm alive someone else going to get hurt by me or they are still suffering from the hurt that I have caused them. 

I'm going to therapy and I feel like I haven't learned how to be right and I am wrong all the time. I feel like I didn't get enough punishment and I haven't repent from my mistakes. It's difficult to be like this. It's affecting the people around me. I'm hurting them."|1
"Is it okay to tell about my friends cutting/other self harm to someone my friend knows? If so when is it okay?

Im asking because my oversea friend did that and is in a bad state right now, she were with others in the beginning of the week, she is distancing from everything now bcs of something I did and believe they dont want to be with her again bcs she said no another day, so I just want to know if I should tell this person about her history of self harm, I already talked about in general whats going on bcs I feel obligated to."|1
"I don't really think this is depression, but anyways I'll be typing here since I've been really annoyed and sad at myself.

I'm a teenager, and one week later is going to be a huge exam for me coz I have to choose electives. For a while ( 3 months or more?), I have been struggling to hear things, recall things that literally just happened. This might have led to my aggressiveness, which I just can't control myself and hurt the people I love. I'm just so annoyed like I can't remember what happened in the past hour or something, and my mother was a survivor of family abuse and she doesn't believe that her kid has mental health issues.

I'm just so freaking tired

Edit: I also hear negative voices in my head which I just can't freaking get them out"|1

My boyfriend has a lotttt of stuff going on right now he barley talks to me, it's been like that for weeks. He said he's sorry and will try his best but I miss him its been too long. His friend just OD and other killed himself and he dislocated his hand and so much more. I have like 3 friends right now 1 just started talking again after a fight and the other I just met. There kind but seem to take hours to respond which is fine cause I know people have stuff going on. I'm always the one there for people but sometimes I just want to yell at everyone to ask me how i'm doing and be here for me. Me and my boyfriend are long distance and my friend never can hangout and the other 2 live in different states. I want a hug but no ones here and everything just sucks."|1
Feeling down tonight. Feeling sick to my stomach. Have been missing work due to my anxiety and depression. My parents make me feel like shit. I’m just not liking myself right now. Would love some advice! Looking to find out who I really truly am|1

"For many reasons, medication isn't a realistic option for me, at least for now.

&#x200B;

But I'm tired of always feeling tired. I don't even do much right now because of online classes, I'm either laying down or sitting. But I'm still tired. When I wake up in the morning, all I can think about is how heavy my body feels, how tired I am, and how I won't be able to move for a while. While I have no plans, I have passive suicidal thoughts, just generally tired of being alive.

&#x200B;

I'm in therapy (client-centered, nondirective). The therapeutic relationship does help in releasing my thoughts. But there's only so much talking can do to fix whatever's going on in my brain...right?

&#x200B;

So what can I do? I leave university in less than 2 years. I CANNOT imagine working every day in this condition. I do want to get better before I really start to lose control. I have a couple of ideas like first of all, fixing my sleep schedule (it's so difficult and I have no results but it's a goal). What are some other ways that have worked for you?"|1
"I'm going to graduate in a month now. I have always been a very hardworking and determined person.

But somehow, back in October 2020, I sort of went through existential crisis. Had to push through the semester, although successful, I have almost completely given up since Jan of this year. I no longer work hard like I used to. I am no longer passionate like I was before. I have no desire to work on my career anymore (also because of how sh*t corporate is). I have no desire to work hard anymore. Although I have other plans in mind which will allow me to quit corporate and earn money through others means, but I'm not going to go into that. Because of despite having a plan B, I still have no desire to push anymore.

But I'm still able to remain very productive in my personal life. I'm able to get up early, take care of myself, cook, clean, workout, read etc. And I feel genuinely happy doing all this. Mostly because it's the first time in 4 years I am now doing things I always wished to do (Doing electrical engineering, so it's very demanding). I am still growing, learning and having the motivation for it. Its just my studies and career which I just don't have the desire to work on anymore. 

I have started to find college courses extremely useless, because I feel better as a person after giving up on the 'hustle/grind' mindset. But then again, I need to make money to live on this earth and I need to stop avoiding the work required to build a career. What do I do????

It's actually the uselessness of college courses that have sucked the life out of me. And why would I be all excited and passionate to find a job where I will just be severely overworked and underpaid, and fired when I'm no longer useful? (Note: I mostly have oil and gas as an option where I live. Its not a stable industry.)"|1

"Hey,

I have trouble with extreme nocturnal jaw clenching, at least that’s what I thought for the last couple of years.

I tried everything basically to get rid of it, without success. 

My doc now believes it could be some kind of somatic disorder or masked depression.

I also have fractured sleep patterns, dizziness, tension headaches every day, very mild fatigue and some exhaustion after exercise. Mostly the day after. And once in a while I feel a bit nervous and shaky, especially in the morning. 

Usually the symptoms go down in the afternoon, which I always related to my muscles relaxing after a night with clenching.
But, apparently that is also commonly seen in a depression.

It must be a very high functioning depression in my case or one which really only expresses itself through my body. I don’t have the classical symptoms of low self-worth, sadness, low mood or lack of of motivation.
The only thing I can feel is maybe frustration...

So maybe... my bruxism and the related symptoms is a rather a symptom of some sort of depression. And by the way, my teeth actually don’t show that much of wear, I mean there is some, but I never cracked a tooth or a splint. So my symptoms seems rather exaggerated compared to the ailment. 

Anybody here who can relate or has had experience with somatic disorders, mask depression etc?"|1

Is lossing the appetite is a symptom of depression? My weight reduced about 6kg in one month and I had suffered depression years ago but currently I totally losing my appetite even with my favourite food.|1
"I am struggling to live with someone who can't look after themselves or the house we live in.

I can't understand why she won't do anything. To clean, to cook even to leave her room. 

I know its the depression, I know she wants to be able to these things but she can't. Its always me, I'm mad and It makes me angry.

6 months engagement and I have had more romance and fun in my life as a 12 year old. This can't be the rest of my life."|1
"Like the title says I’m dealing with what seems to be a sudden onset episode of crippling depression. 

My last job I feel triggered this. I really gave it my all there and I’m not sure why but the manager just didn’t like me. I have aspbergers and I’m a little awkward so maybe that was it I’m not sure. 

Anyway I left that job and my new job is very relaxed but regardless of this fact the moment I wake up I’m filled with dread and a sense of impending doom. I almost feel like I need to admit myself or take some time off. I’m a healthy 34m though (at least physically) and I’m ashamed to ask my girlfriend and explain to my job that I need some time to get past this. 

I make sure to run everyday to keep the most dangerous thoughts at bay but I’m legitimately cracking. Any advice on how to approach this with my girlfriend and most importantly with my job of which I just started 2 weeks ago.

Thanks"|1
I just went through another breakup and again for the same reasons; my partner doesn’t love me. It’s my third time for this exact reason (i usually never get past the talking stage) and I’m convinced something is wrong with me. I hear about how kind and sweet and understanding I am but it’s just not enough for people to want to stay with me. I don’t know if I’m not attractive enough, or funny enough, or active enough. I really just feel deficient and lonely and crave the intimate connection that my friends have with their partners. I can’t bear a life alone and I’m wondering if its hopeless and I’ll never find someone. I’m afraid and my chest feels empty.|1
I’m 19, going home next week for the first time after being in the military for the past year and a couple months. I’m being separated early because of depression and anxiety and feel like I chose to take the easy route and get out instead of try and get help before being separated. Now that I am a week from going home I’m starting to see reality come crashing down and how much of a mistake I made even if I didn’t like the military. My mother is excited to see me come back, but my father I feel is extremely displeased and is starting to give up on me. He told me after dropping out of college and now the military I am becoming a quitter and it doesn’t look good. He also tells me that I need to go back to school or I will be a failure, but the reason I dropped out was because I can’t even give a presentation in front of a class because I’m to much of a pussy to do so. I want to blame anxiety for this, but I feel like that’s just me dodging the blame yet again. Now that I’m basically “quitting” the military I don’t know what my next step is and that I have already fucked up my chances at success. Between my type of discharge and my indecisiveness on a career I’m bound to end up a failure. Not sure what to do next if anything.|1
What do you do when everything seems like a chore , everything you do feels so difficult and not worth doing . How do I move past this feeling ? I feel worthless I want to start working out and make myself feel better more confident but I fear failure I want to quit before I begin to save myself the heartache . I’m 29 and just got my driving permit and I’m deathly afraid to fail the road test because I don’t want to have to repeat it again and feel that humiliation that comes with it . Everything feels so heavy, things normal people do on a daily basis just feel like so much .|1
"Anyone else have a hard time handling unexpected changes? My bf and I are spending the long weekend at his family’s lake house, which is my happy place. It’s one of the few things that consistently makes me actually feel happy... being out on the water, floating on a raft, cold drink in hand, etc. I’ve been looking forward to this weekend for awhile, packed like 3 days early, mapped out all our meal plans... everything to be totally prepared for a good weekend. (Planning helps me manage my anxiety) Well, woke up this morning and realized it’s cold outside. Stupid me just assumed that since it was in the 80s-90s for the last several weeks that it’d be warm this weekend too. This has totally thrown me into a depressive episode and I have no idea what to do. I just want to go home and lay in my bed. I don’t want to ruin the weekend for my bf but I just can’t handle this being different than how I’d planned. To make it worse, he KNEW it was going to be cold and didn’t happen to mention it the whole time we were talking and planning for the weekend. Does anyone have any coping skills to deal with a situation like this and the accompanying mood swing?

"I'm a 30 year old woman and have no friends due to a lifelong battle with social anxiety and depression. Besides that I have no special hobbies, good looks, or social skills that would attract any friends to me let along any romantic interests. Usually I'm able to keep feelings of hopelessness at bay by escaping into a daydream, show, book, or movie. However last week it all came to a head when a girl I developed a massive crush (more like hyper-fixation) on during this past year of isolation got a bf who makes 3x as much money as I do. It just brought up all my feelings of inadequacy. My ""comfort person"" has become a source of discomfort now so I can't hide in daydreaming. I just sit everyday with the cold, hard reality of myself whom I dislike tremendously. Trying to find a way to improve but I can't see through the fog right now. I know eventually I'll feel better but all there is now is pain and I don't know if I want to live through months of it especially because I know that it's a cycle and it will come back around again. 

One thing that I did take away from this guy she's with is that he's a record producer. He's doing something he likes doing (generally I don't like the guy because he's sketchy but that's not important). I currently make decent money (90k) but I hate what I do. I want to go back to school for film production but I'm afraid. 

Basically I just feel stuck. Does anyone have advice on how to push through a major depressive episode? Also potentially changing careers?"|1
I am useless. I am awfull. I am disgusting|1
"It’s weird, cause I remember she meant the world to me, I remember what feeling loving someone felt like, and I remember I was certain she was going to be a mother to my children.But I just can’t remember almost anything from our relationship.

It’s been almost 4 years since we broke up, I have a new partner now, and she helped me a lot with my emotional blockade, I’m still struggling with expressing my emotions, something that was so easy for me to do before.

This is my first long term relationship since then.Our 1 year anniversary is coming up, and I felt so affraid when I realised I don’t remember so many things from my former relationship, I just keep having dreams of my former partner that are so vivid and real, that I just wanna puke because everything is so real and back to normal until I wake up.

I don’t know is it possible that I developed some form of PTSD, or what?Did I somehow make myself forget about so many things?

So many questions, not many answers, 
I’m asking in hope that someone can share their experiences and insights."|1
"He said all those terrible things about you, and yet instead of condemning him, you defended him. And you said it was because he’s your friend, and you’d defend your friends no matter what. Right or wrong doesn’t matter, the fact that I was also a friend didn’t matter, did it? You wouldn’t even apologise for all the pain you caused me…when we first met, I believed you were somebody great, and that somehow, you could be even better. But you disappointed me. Was I wrong? Did I expect too much? 

I tried my best to point out how you drifted from the path. Tried to show how your actions had hurt the people around you, and that doing bad things was a step towards being a bad person. Maybe I was wrong, but I know I had good intentions. I know you assumed I wanted him away from you, because I wanted you for myself. Truth is, I never believed you could love me, it was only a dream to me, and I never expected you to love me in return.

I am tired of being alone. 
I am tired of being sad. 
I am tired of being alive."|1
"Im a 21 year old guy I work with kids at an after daycare center and I love my job with every ounce of my being. It’s like an escape for me and brings me so much fulfillment and energy and joy. I don’t even care about myself so it’s feels so nice to have the kids to care about. I really do care about them all 

I’m a very sensitive person and get upset over criticism cause I grew up in an abusive house 

Today 2 kids got hurt outside so I got one of them an ice pack (cause my boss asked me too) and i was just asking them questions and making sure they’re feeling okay and they’re just talking to me telling me about it and all of a sudden my boss interrupts and is like “don’t dwell on it, stop dwelling move on move on” and shoos me away. 

I felt so embarrassed and worthless like why can’t I even talk to the kids? :(    I felt like they deserved someone to talk to as a distraction while they’re just sitting there hurting. There wasn’t even anything else for me to do my boss shoos me away and I was just standing around like a worthless idiot with nothing to do 

One of the girls has a permanent bad leg from a previous injury also so that’s also why I was making extra sure theyre okay. Later on i noticed that she was limping and I pointed it out to my boss and she got all bitchy and was like “yeah we got it under control we have her records”

Sorry for caring. I’m just trying to do my job. Should I just not care about the kids and ignore their pain?? My boss always puts me down and makes me feel bad like that. Nothing I do is ever good enough."|1
"My depression comes and goes. Lately I’ve been conflicted about where I am in life. Need to find a new job, move out, etc. I’m 25f


Last night I micro-slept while driving and completely destroyed a brick mailbox. My car is fucked. I feel absolutely terrible about myself 
I can’t even afford to fix this mess 

I feel so worthless"|1
I'm sure if I die one day, that's only by suicide. Just wanted to vent, not to make people worse. Sorry you had to go through this piece of shit.|1
Not fully alone as I have myself. I'm making more peace with myself and being a loner is all I really ever knew. Its honestly not even super bad. I enjoy it more these days. A part of me though wishes I wasn't. A part of me wishes I didn't have depression because I know if i didn't I could have a girlfriend or get laid or find it easy to enjoy life. Depression makes it impossible to feel confidence. It makes it impossible to feel anything good. So no wonder people don't like me. We are a reflection of how we feel on the inside and for me its damn nothing 99% of the time. So no. Telling me to have confidence is BS I've worked out for so many years done all that crap and I still feel nothing only deadness.  Hate life|1
"Almost 3 years ago, I was able to start getting my binge eating symptoms under control and also establish an exercise routine. It immensely helped out with my confidence and general mood.

2 years ago, I got a job that paid well and allowed me to have the health insurance to get therapy and medication for my depression and anxiety. I hoped it would mean I could eventually move out from my parents whom I am still living with after an event during my grad school years that triggered some massive anxiety for me.

7 months ago, I started dating my boyfriend who has improved all aspects of my life. I am constantly amazed to have found him because I'm so used to such shit support from my 'friends' and feeling like I have to earn someone's love... And every moment with him, I relearn that I never had to force myself to settle for such a problematic existence.

But my anxiety was triggered by work and I fell off of my fitness goals... Resulting in me losing all that progress. And now I've lost my job because my anxiety just made my job too difficult to handle.

Thankfully, my boyfriend is still my support, but no matter how hard he tries, he can't alleviate all my issues. I'm so frustrated because I just wanted to move towards my future with him, but my jobless state has put a dent in those aims. So right now, I'm still stuck with my parents, particularly my psychologically abusive mother... Who won't listen to me about how her words are harmful to me. She constantly insults my body because of my weight. She yells at me to not be lazy as I stay in my room most of the time... Despite the fact that I have been trying to work on job searches and rededicating to working on my art and writing.

I hate how much I need out and away from my mother to help my mental health... But I'm stuck. I'm back to wondering if it is worth it, this struggle."|1
"When I first wanted to get help I went to my doctor to get a recommendation on who could help me. She referred me to a therapist and a psychiatrist and I've been seeing all three for a while. After my third month with my doctor she told me she thought there might be more than just depression. I just assumed there wasn't anything else since none of them ever gave me more to my diagnosis than depression. Over the past three or so months I've been thinking my doctors comment and I tried to look up some other disorders that I might have symptoms of and just never let them know (I've gone undiagnosed with depression for most of my life so even basic symptoms of depression I just saw as normal). I ended up finding some disorders that I have symptoms of that I've never really expressed to them. I hate the idea of being precieved as a ""Doctor Web MD"". Would it be wrong for me to ask? Maybe not directly as a specific disorders but just bringing up the symptoms"|1
I've always been insecure and hated myself a little too much.  I hate it but I can't too much about it. there are brief moments when I'll see myself beautiful but they don't last that long because the moment I see someone way better I'd start thinking.. what's the point, I'll never be good enough. and this life for me is just an endless effort to b good enough for someone.. but I don't think I'll ever be a good daughter or best friend or significant other because I'm too much and not enough at the same time. it hurts to live.|1
"I'm 28, mom's in her 50's. She's kind of a free spirit like me, and damned hard to keep at that, another thing we most likely share. 

I grew up through my original parents marriage, which was extremely tumultuous. They divorced in my teens. Later on, she married my step-dad while I was still a teen, I think around my sophomore year of high school all the way up until this year when they split, which to my knowledge was just a few weeks ago. And NOW, she posted on fb about falling in love again with some bloke.

I'm just...annoyed. she's going to give me details in a few hours. I'm fresh on learning this burgeoning info. I'm just peeved to heck that she's suddenly moved onto some fellow after this like it's just nothing. I think she should just enjoy being single after jumping relationships so quickly in my younger years. My dad and step-dad, who I still consider my step-dad weren't the only ones, she's been a free lover in the space between marriages. I want to understand her, but it's difficult. She can't just be single and try enjoying life that way for a while? Is it because she's in her 50's and people that age are a certain brand of fast-moving?

I don't know who the dude is. I saw his fb and he seems like an alright guy, but I just don't really care about that at the moment. I'm already having struggles with my own mental health and maintaining the relationships I already have. Being social is extremely hard for me. I can't imagine fostering something with this dude anymore than I would a regular shopper. I don't know how to feel about all this.

I want to give her my full support. I'm right pissed off and want to give her some of the business I feel is appropriate. An elder isn't always wiser, but maybe there is something to it? I want to understand her. It could be me. I'm stressed out all of the time and anger quite easily, and my moods change, and I can't focus. I'm receiving help soon when my doctor finally diagnoses me. So, I could be misplacing my anger. I hope that's the case. 

Can someone please give me advice? Thanks"|1
"Im in the paradox, back then i never enjoy present but i know one day i would be better. But now i can be happy at present but seeing future is really make anxious and easily trigger my depression.

"
I just feel so lonely and down all the time. I don’t even know why I feel this way but I want more than anything for it to stop. I haven’t even really had a real smile in so long.. 

I’m starting to feel like I’m losing myself.. I just want to be happy again I want this to go away I’m so sick of being unhappy. 

It doesn’t help that since it’s depression and not just some emotion I never know why I feel this way, I just do. Since I don’t know why it makes me question if I even have the right to be this sad. It’s like I’m overreacting or something. I just feel worthless, like I don’t matter to anyone.

I’m so mentally exhausted, I’m not really eating I’m barely sleeping but then I have days where all I want to do is cry and sleep for hours upon hours. It takes everything I have not to breakdown at night. 

Anytime I talk to anyone I just don’t want to open up because anytime I do I feel like I don’t have the right to feel this way or they just don’t seem to care. Especially since I can’t explain it. 

Whenever someone has something else going on I just put my problems aside because I feel like it’s not as important. Which just makes it build up more and I become even more down. I don’t know what to do. 

Nothing helps, the medicine I’m on does nothing. I’ve been going to therapy but after each session I just feel even worse after it. I’m just beyond lost. 

I put everything I can into attempting to help people go through things or at least try to be there for them, but I can’t do anything to help myself. I feel so useless.. I just want someone to be there for me like I am for them.

Just someone please help me.."|1
 So I've been diagnosed with depression several weeks ago by my therapist. Over the past several months it was very apparent that I had depression. Over the past week, however, I've felt less sad. I'm still just as hopeless, but I'm less sad. Why is this? Why do I hate this so much? Is this the end of a depressive episode or something? Is the depression fake? I don't know. I still don't want to do anything. I'm still as lazy and unmotivated as ever. I'm just less sad. I honestly can't make out my emotions much of the time. I'm so confused.  Please, someone give me a possible explanation. I hate living like this.|1
"5 years ago today I graduated high school. I was strung out, homeless, and lonely. I was so depressed I couldn’t function. My mother called me after the ceremony telling me I’m a disappointment and that she’s going home. It was the worst day of my life. 
It was 5 years ago today. Since I hit 20 my mental health has slowly deteriorated, and last week it cost me the first good job I’ve ever gotten. In five years all I’ve changed is that I’m wishing I was dead just in a different place. I feel hopeless and alone, and that my mental health will continue to ruin my life. 
And before anybody asks, yes I’m medicated and in treatment but neither have done anything to help me control my symptoms. 
How do I live in a world being the way I am? How do I learn to accept living being miserable?"|1
"It’s just that. I’ve got no friends, never been in a relationship ( i’m looking for something serious ). I’m lonely.

I used to enjoy writing screenplays, watching movies, listening to my favorite band ( Måneskin ) but, in the last few years, i couldn’t stop comparing to my only friend ( he’s not my friend anymore ), and his perfect life with his perfect girlfriend. They’re going on a cruise this summer. They’re living their life, while i’m stuck here alone. 

Every time, i hear guys that are “socially inept” with girls getting a relationship after a bit. Everyone is dating nowadays. I’m feeling bad. I don’t even know where/how to meet new people. 

I used to go to the gym, keep myself fit cause i wanted to, but then i kept on comparing myself to others. Their lives... how could they talk to girls.

Now i’m not fat, i’m still pretty fit, but i’m contemplating suicide, cause i seriously stopped having hope. I’ve never felt good enough for dating, in my entire life. I’m even severely balding, and i know it’ll destroy my confidence, if i ever had one.

It’s like being a trash. I’m useless, and i hate myself so much. I know i’m sensitive, i know i’m caring and somehow funny if i want to, but i just don’t have the balls.

I really need help..."|1
"I never felt so alone
The hall bright
Yet all I’m seeing Is black

Held down, holding on

I try to break free
But the force is equal 
Held down by myself 

There is a light at the end
It keeps getting closer
Yet so far from reach 

Grip still tight and firm
Can’t move, Cant breath

The light still moves toward me 
Steadily moving nearer 

I can stand once again 

The hall is bright 
Surrounded by my loved ones
Some further than others 
Pushed away during the struggle 

But they’ll move closer
I know they will"|1
"It was gonna have to happen, some incentives are a good thing to get out your confort zone. I'm listening to people chat fluently and effortlessly together, like they never got affected by having to lockdown and stay locked down in their own homes.

I withdrew cause of the pandemic and depression.Seeing people go at it doesn't make me feel bitter, makes me feel stupid for my sacrifices. Could have still done things safely, been in touch and practiced socialising. Now I'm in fear if anyone I know bumps into me, saw someone I know at the station and never repeated a mantra so hard in my life ""don't notice me, don't notice me"". I don't think I can let my friends see me anymore, I know one day in a positive way to slowly ween from my fears sure. Not now. I really don't want this. Please the world and all of its natural forces, please don't have someone come up to me and strike conversation."|1

"Im not sure if this is a thing or if theres a word for this but im sure someone out there must know what i mean...

Ive been feeling better the past few months, ive been taking vitamins to help and it almost feels so new to be in a better place. Its living in an unknown world and it feels like a whole new learning experience. You feel kind of unsure of what to make of it.

More recently, ive been slowly feeling myself slip down back into the tips of depression. And part of me feels so comforted by it. Its weird i know.. But I've realized its something I've always lived in. I've always suffered major depression for most of my life, even being so young that i had no idea what depression even was. It is something i am familiar with. It became my comfort zone. It's all I've ever known.

It's not like i dont want to not get better. Obviously i do. But something about depression just feels like home. Where my time feeling better was like a mini vacation. (If that makes sense). I feel like the darkness and depth of depression shows the truth, the reality. Its almost grounding because it makes me feel ""awake"" to the dark reality but also you feel so desperate to wake up. Where feeing better was more like a fantasy, living in a dream world, like you dont care about anything in a free spirit type of way. Going with the flow, no hard feelings. 

I hope someone else can relate and if you know what im talking about, how was your experience? (If your up for sharing). Im not sure what to do or how to go about it. I think im just posting to journal my thoughts and share my experience.

"Growing up, I realised my parents never stopped treating me like a child no matter how independent I try to be. It is deeply frustrating and depressing as whenever I try talk back and reason with them, they dismiss almost everything I say as they like to claim that since they are older and more experienced, they are always right and I have to follow whatever they do. I have almost no free will  and it scares the shit out of me.

Does anyone have similar parents who infantilise you even though you are a grown adult? How do you deal with it?"|1

I’m only been taking them for a couple weeks but I’ve decided I’m done. It’s so confusing. I  began to stabilize. My mental state was improving. However my suicidal thoughts got a little worse and my memory is still bad. Can’t tell if the depression got better or worse. The meds got rid of the the scary stuff (like cutting myself because I some what thought there were bugs under my skin 🙄). I just want to go back to where I was before. Or maybe I don’t. It’s so confusing. Anyways I basically don’t feel comfortable getting better (on drugs specifically for some reason). I’m diagnosed with ocd but very well could be a misdiagnose/I have another illness, after all the crazy stuff that has happened this past month and a half. I hate taking drugs for an undiagnosed illness. It makes me feel like it strips me of all power.|1
I honestly don’t know what to do. I just want to die. I don’t even feel like it can be labelled as ‘suicidal’. Okay mood, bad mood even the rare good mood, 24/7, 7 days a week dying seems the only logical thing to do. I do not want to live this life so why do I have to be forced to. Why is it better if I am alive in excruciating pain then dead where I can’t feel anything? I really don’t understand. The only thing I can do know is be lightly amused by the stupidity as I slowly become more and more crazy.|1
I get drunk occasionally with my friends and when we get drunk they always tell me that I’m a nicer more pleasurable version of myself when drunk. They say that I’m just not as depressing to be around when drunk. Now honestly it’s not super bad they said this in passing and without context it’s not too bad. Unfortunately since COVID started I’ve been struggling with alcohol use and have been a borderline addict for awhile now and they are very aware of this too. I’ve started to go down a bit of a hole due to these statements and honestly i give up on trying to get my shit together|1
Lately I’ve been feeling very bad about myself and I don’t seem to find motivation in anything I do. Even tho I did better than ever in school with my grades or I get nice comments about my abilities I still feel like what I do is never enough and that I’m no capable of achieving the things I wish for. I’m 22 year’s old, in my last semesters of a 3d animation’s degree, I used to believe in myself but lately it’s been nearly impossible for me to do it. I’ve always been thankful with my parents for supporting my studies but this late year we have been really struggling with our economy and I feel guilty with them. I started working but all I been getting in this animation studio is projects and no payment. It’s so frustrating, I don’t know how to face this situation and I feel like a burden for my family, tbh I’m afraid of that feeling bc it’s been years I’ve felt like this and I don’t miss it, I’m so embarrassed to admit that I even tried to kill myself in those times, I’ve never told that to anyone. I’m writing here for the first time as a relief of all these feelings I been keeping, idk why but I don’t feel like telling it to my friends or my bf. They are great people, I really love them, I think they don’t expect from me to feel this way bc it has always been difficult for me to open up about the way I really feel, I really wish I could talk about it or pay for therapy rn. My family is not an option for me to talk about this, like I said we’re having a hard time with money so my parents are as stressed and irritated as I’ve never seen it before, they feel so much preassure on themselves and the last thing they need is getting worried for me. My relationship w my mom is damaged and this hurts me so much but Idk how to make it better, I feel like she finds me useless and I don’t blame her. My father is unemployed and struggling everyday with getting rejected in job interviews bc of his age. My sister lives in her own bubble w her own problems and we don’t get along anymore. Since she’s in a toxic relationship we came apart, everytime I try to have a conversation with her she says I talk too much or that I’m bothering her. Sorry about my english, thanks if you got to this point.|1

Every time i do i just want to scratch my face off. I have visible scratches on my face and all over my body. Its been the main cause of my depression and the reason for my many suicide attempts. Its not fair how my pretty friends get to live their life freely, telling me ""no stopp youre so pretty"" while they reject 2 guys evry hour and i barely got 1 in my life. Ive stayed in my home for a month straight i havent gone out, not even to the store i just feel so ashamed , im so embarrassed of what i look like.

"I wasn't always emotionally numb to everything around me. I used to care about people. Their problems, how their day went, i cared about them just in general. Now, I talk to people and I cant feel anything. I wanna care but I cant; talking to them just feels monotonous to me. Even with my girlfriend, I can't feel anything. I love her so much and would do anything for her, but right now Im just emotionally not there. She tells me her problems and in my head I could care less. I wanna genuinely care about our conversations and not just half ass it. I still wanna be with her but I don't deserve her right now. Even with my friends I really care about, I cant feel shit. It feels like talking to them is like a job that brings no satisfaction. 


Somethings I've considered as factors as to why I might be currently going through this:

-Stuck with the same schedule every single day for months now. (Online School -> Eat -> Talk to my gf and some friends online -> Sleep -> Repeat) We're LDR by the way. 

-Burnt out from everything 

-Barely go outside and meet up with my actual real life friends, due to my schedule and reluctance of wanting to move. 

Someone please help me, I feel so lost. I don't know how to get out of this cycle. This just came out of the blue and I've just realized it right now. I wanna feel something again, I wanna care, but how do I make that happen?"|1

"Im a freshman 1 week till and im a sophmore. She was the best girl i could of ever asked for she made my freshman year the best year of my life. Ive been in 3 relationships the first one i didn't know how to be a boyfriend. The second i used to move on from the first and broke her heart. But my third.... i met her in in 7th grade and started to get to know her in thr summer of 8th grade we had alot of the same interest and became bestfriends. Little did i know i was slowly falling in love with her. She would ask my  why i didn't say i love you and good night. I would tell her its weird but i was actually in love with her and scared of her finding out. Im a very internal person meaning i keep things to myself and im quiet so not much friends. This girl was quiet but... she was a 10/10 in everything body,face,personality you name it. She eventually fell for me and called me her end game. I was the first boy she kissed. I was the first person she fell in love with. Everyone else was just people to her. We were very lovey dovie and everything at our first months. We planned on having kids. We planned on all that nice stuff. We did everything together and we also did some sexual things. She was the best thing that ever happened to me. My first gf told me i will find someone better and she was right... everything was perfect we talked day and night clomgy towards each other. Everyday. Then we started our first argument nothing bad but more came. I start to think she lossed feelings but me thinking that just caused me problems and at the end caused her to actually lose them. We dated for a year. I wish and i wish me and her stayed together. She found me as 10/10 aswell somehow. I was just so lucky. Now i cry and weep. Everyday. She loved me. She just couldn't stay in love with me. And she didn't want me to suffer or hurt me so she left. She randomly told me lets break up and it was done. I tried everything to win her back texting her for 6 hours straight without stopping just dtraight not a minute apart. She eventually answered and felt really bad for my suffering then people were mean to me in school the following moring. I had 5 dreams of her that night and i had another the next night. They were good dreams but waking up with the realization that she is gone is the worse feeling because  you know its all your fault. She was my joy. I was hers. We were soulmates until we weren't. She told me i would find someone better but. She was that someone. And i do not want to fall for someonr else starting all that crap over. Im happy shes more ok than me but im just straight up deppressed over the subject. I even went to her house the day she dumped me. I came home balling with all my things j gave her without another chance. It was a sad and hot bike home. My only tip to anyone else is shut your fucking mouth when you have nothing nice to say. I wish and wish we stayed together. She didn't think i could change back but i know i can. Shes done with me now and has blocked me on everything becUse she doesn't want to be friends at the moment because she thinks ill be more sad. She was so important to me she made everything better i even started to have all A's because of her making me happy and motivated. I fucked up so badly by not being pure respect. And when she dumped me i didn't believe her until she didn't say ""kidding""... thats my story with her ♡"|1
" I’m not really sure where to start with this. I can’t tell if the fact I feel lonely is making my work suffer, I’m hopeless at getting a partner and more. Bit of a backstory will put a TL:DR down the bottom before asking my questions. Thanks so much for taking the time to read and maybe offer some advice on my situation. 

So in May 2020 I (now 35M) left a 5 year marriage with my ex (now 35F) due to a long rafter of issues. We were together 7 years and while we had some good times, it was a slow decline from the day I said “I do.” I don’t want to type a long story on this, the short version is as follows. About 2 years into our marriage we got pregnant and lost our unborn shield to a misscarrage. I think she was slowly already declining before this but this was the catalyst that officially started things in my eyes. As the years went on I felt like I was walking on eggshells on top of a minefield, had issues of double standards, emotional manipulation, she would occasionally throw things during an argument and much more. Intimacy was no existent, what little hugs and kisses I got without having to beg, bride or deal with felt like a chore. Sex was once about every 2 months and she would be on her phone open her legs and tell me I had 10 minutes….. Looking back I maybe should have seen all this as reg flags. But she was only my second real relationship and I felt lonely and desperate. I’m much better these days but more on this later. Long story short, she was a bitch who even cheated on me in the final days of our relationship. 

The other 2 issues are my work and weight. When we broke up in May last year we were both about 165kg, give or take a few kilos. I’m happy to say a year on and I’m 135kg, looking at what photos I’ve seen of her…. Well let's just say I think I know where my lost kilos went. I’m still 135kg, which has a huge effect on my chances of getting a relationship. Let's not sugar coat this fact, it’s true and I know and accept it. Still working on losing weight but this kind of overlaps into the other issues I have.  

I’ve been working on a side project for about 11 years now for my own animation series. It’s about 500 episodes long with a huge original world. I’ve had my work appraised and had promising feedback and offers to pitch once it is all ready, but most days I find it hard to work up the drive to start typing. This is also the situation with losing weight, most days I eat something I shouldn’t or fail to workout at all. I do manage to play video games most days as I think it’s my way of coping with my issues, like being lonely or feeling sorry for myself. I also have periods of ups and downs, where I feel down for a while only to pick myself up and go strong for a while to rinse and repeat over and over again. I can’t seem to put any stability into my like in regards to my work, weight loss and other commitments.

Making friends is also a challenge as I’ve spent most of my childhood moving around, and I moved cross country (Aus) to escape my ex and my loving family have been nice enough to take me in while I get back on my feet. So in this new country town I’ve made a few okay friends but nothing really life changing that won't soon disappear when I move out of town. Moving out of this town is something I want to do once my work is ready to pitch…. Thought I’d be out after a year but not so. 

I recently (last week) broke up with a new GF as well. We are still good friends, just chalking our situation up to travelling different directions in life and she is now busier than when I met her with a new job and her daughter. I still have her as a friend, with the benefits I might add (woot!) I lost no tears over this as we were open with each other from start to finish and there is no hatred or ill will from either side towards each other. She is amazing, and I’m lucky to have her in my life.

These last 2 weeks have got my brain working overtime as my parents whom I’m saying with had to travel across the country as my father’s dad is on his way out. I stayed home as this is my step father (whom I love better than my sperm donor and respect very much) who I treat like my real father, but never really knew my grandfather as my dad didn’t come into my life until I was 16. They are still not home and I’ve felt very lonely being home alone for the last 2 weeks. Done hardly any of my writing, not exercised much and even got a few takeout meals and put 1kg back on. 

I know that finishing my work so I can move, losing weight to better my chances at a relationship plus better health is a great idea and making some friends so I can have a social life is a must (main reason I want to move, this is a small country town in the middle of nowhere).

TL:DR - My life is a mess of problems and I need advice on practical steps I can take to fix them please.

Time for some questions please.

1. What are practical steps I can take so I can build healthy habits and routines to get my writing done and lose weight?
2. Should I still be looking for friends or a relationship during this time? (Note not aggressive looking, just check some online apps maybe once a week or go out once a fortnight to see what happens)
3. Being in a small country town with not much to do, and my recently ex great GF (who is still a great friend) not having much time. I feel I need somewhat of a social life or friends I can be with every so often. But being in this small town I feel it is very hard to achieve this goal. Thoughts? 
4. I have already learnt how not to let my lonely feelings get the better of me (fact I was with my only recently ex GF for 5 months proves it), but what other self improvement ideas can you maybe suggest please? (note I treat life like a glass half full, still holding hope things can and will get better, but this optimism does sometimes bring me down briefly as nothing has happened, before I pick myself up again (guess I’m in a down bit now, but this time I want practical solutions, not blind hope))
5. Anything else you can offer tips or advice for you feel will help?"|1
"hey this is a small vent

"All my life I was the ""good child"". I was always on my best behaviour, had awesome grades, did my chores, never fought with anyone. That certainly wasn't just me being my natural self but rather the fear of diappointing the people around me (who had very high standards). Nowadays I just basically isolate myself from anyone and everyone. I only get comments from my family about that but I really can't change it. And it's not just them. Even minor things as cancelling appointments (with very good reason) makes me feel absolutely terrible. I seem to have to always give 150% and the second I don't, I'm nothing but a failure. Does anyone else have this/ knows of ways how to handle it?"|1
"
Normally I’d say this is a great thing but I am incredibly impulsive have binge eating disorder and am supposed to return to my job on Monday (frequent binges kept me from going in for three weeks). 

My life is in utter disrepair to the point I have 100% married the idea that it’s all over. I’ve had parasuicide attempts and during my last manic episode in November I spent a week in Florida and came back with no money to my name

In this exciting panic I’ve already desperately threw out all the food I had portioned out for the week and bought food at 7-11 just for tonight and I’ll try to out fast Jesus starting tomorrow for what must be my 700th attempt (I only ever make it 1-2 out of 40 days )  I wouldn’t count it as a binge but still 

I’m afraid if this keeps going on what bullshit I’ll do I don’t think I’ll harm myself I’m just seeing all these young thin college kids walking around town having fun meanwhile I literally wrote this green text:

I am always in a depressive mood and I constantly bother everybody. Depression is ruining my life and it won’t go away. Trying to positive gives me this painful and uncomfortable feeling (I don’t know why). Trying to cheer myself up and all that hurts me mentally and physically seriously it does. I always try to be better at the things I love doing but it’s a no go. I have no reason to live life. I think that being alive is a waste of time. What’s the point of being alive if you can’t even enjoy life? If I’m miserable all the time then aren’t I better off dead? That makes sense to me. Nobody likes me I’m the worst person in the world and I hate myself all the time. There’s no hope for me I hate my life.|1
"I feel happy. I have great friends who support me with everything I do and family that care about me but I’d give everything up instantly. I’ve been depressed for 7 years. I tired everything to cure it but for some reason it’s always there even when I’m happy but there’s never a time where I told myself I don’t want to die. If something were to happen to me I’d be fine with it. I mean that’s what I say now but that’s just 
 how I feel and I can’t help it. At this point I don’t feel anything anymore nothing feels genuine anymore. I’m content with what I have but I hate my self and my life."|1
"I just want to die, and nothing is worth it anymore...
But I shouldn't be depressed at all..!

I have a great life, a supportive family, loving siblings, adorable cats, so why am I still so sad?!?

It's so painful, and I just want the pain to stop.. my parents know everything, and are super supportive, but I feel so guilty for putting this on them..

I have a great life, and a loving family.. why the fuck do I want to die so badly??? Why can't I just be happy???"|1
I have experienced the other signs of depression for almost a year now except the suicidal thoughts. That’s why I tend to discount my experience, thinking that I’m just overacting|1
I finally told someone (my sister) what I have been feeling for a long time and that I feel like I needed help. I broke down but she was supportive. It was so hard for me to ask for help as I was the eldest, but I did it. Here’s to many more steps 🤞|1
In order to pass college I need 80% on all tests and exams. Idk anymore how I will do that. Im not a bright kid. My brain is dead. My personality is dead. I cant do anything. Anything. I'm truly sad existence is a thing. Its so fucking cruel.|1
I feel like I’m dying everyday and just getting frustrated and no where.|1
"I’ve been abandoned by so many for my depression. Yes, I’m often negative. Yes, I often ask for them to listen. Yes, I often disagree with their advice. But I do so with respect, consideration, and the constant offer to listen to them and give advice to them.

Yet so many people have abandoned me because I’m so depressed. People have their limits, of course, and it’s not their responsibility to fix me.

But when what I’m asking for is an occasional ear to listen, and thoughts of encouragement while I’m working as hard as I can to fix myself, it’s not right to respond with vitriol and hate. It’s not right to insist that you know what it’s like to be depressed, then insist that I have no right to feel down and dour.

From someone who has been left to sit in my despair by so, so many who once insisted they’d always be there for me, please don’t abandon your friends, even when it’s difficult. Set your boundaries, express your limits, but don’t blame them for their own suffering and leave them alone in their battles.

Thank you."|1
"Hi, everyone. I noticed a pattern in life that I tend to self-reject before someone rejects me. It's like protecting myself from an unfavourable outcome. I've distanced myself from everyone besides parents and lost all interest to pursue any new relatioships. Sometimes people seem nice and contact me, but after a day or a few of communication I rejecf myself and excuse from any further interaction. In some cases I begin to think they don't want any good for me, which I  never figure out anyway.
In general, it sucks because I am lonely and continue this pattern. I'm almost certain I've self-depressed myself during the past few years and now the mood is unstable day by day. If something reminds of past experiences, I slide down quickly and then go on a roll of hiding and rejecting myself from any current interaction with new people.

Is there a way to easy up this state?"|1
"Idk if this will make sense to anyone, but I feel like shit because I haven't attempted or anything and I'm just really confused and shit so I wrote out my thoughts and was hoping for some advice.

I want to die.
I want to live.
I want to die, but I still want to live.
I already feel dead. 
I just want to get rid of it.
Why don't I want to die completely?
I have every reason to want to.
Why do I want to live? What's so special about it?
It makes me hurt after all.
Am I afraid?
If so, of what?
Dying or Death?
Why do I keep holding on at the last second?
What is there to hold on to?
What is keeping me connected to life?
Is it fear or hope?
Why can't I want to die?
It all hurts so bad, and I want it to go away.
I want to want to die more.
It isn't that I dont want to die, it's that I don't want to commit suicide.
But why?
I have all these 'why's, but I have no 'because's.
I hate that.
So fucking much.
I feel like because of these feelings of not wanting to die, my feelings of wanting to die don't matter.
They aren't good enough.
They don't count.
And I hate that even more."|1
"I used to be pretty articulated, and have always perceived myself that way, but lately it's as if I can barely even form sentences or make conversation without it requiring a lot of energy and resources from me. I will stumble upon words, take longer breaks (due to looking for right words), and generally just feel like not being able to get the message across in the way that I want to. It's like I weirdly have to put an effort into it, and as a result that only makes me want to isolate myself even more than I already did.

I was diagnosed with a severe depression not too long ago and was wondering if that, in any way, can play a role in a person's ability to speak. I know that loss of focus and concentration is common (something I'm also severely suffering from), but have any of you had any experiences similar to mine as far as speech goes?"|1
Today I woke up this morning, went to work, which was a good distraction. I get home and ponder about why I feel so alone. I have my parents yes, but they don’t understand what I’m going through, and they just expect me to always be happy. I live in a small college town and honestly can’t think of a single friend. I don’t have any roommates and have been living alone for the past 16 months.|1
I had severe acne from the ages of 13 to now (17) and it completely obliterated my self confidence and made me have insanely bad social anxiety. I don’t want to leave my room ever and it’s so demotivating. My parents finally put me on medication but I don’t think it gets rid of 5 years of being introverted and feeling empty and depressed. Now I’m so stressed because of the SAT and applying to colleges. I just want to be genuinely happy and content with my life.|1
my soul is crying and screaming at me to leave this body in this hell that we call earth. im a drug addict to opiates anything that will numb the pain that is destroying me. im losing myself and my mind. i cant live normally anymore, i might not go to one of my bestfriends funeral tomorrow because my body hurts and my soul is tired. i lost him to suicide and depression. i dont want to end up dead but im scared, myentire life is changing and i dont see hope anymore. for some reason i try and picture the future but i cant, i literally do not see anything its a black canvas. i screamed at god tonight asking why me, i screamed at him in my car until my voice gave out. i dont know how to get myself out of this darkness, i dont know if i can. i dont want to die but i dont want to be alive anymore. idk why i am even writing this, i guess it kind of helps but not really. my soul is rotting and i feel physical pain from it. i feel i dont belong anywhere, i want to go home but i dont know where home is|1
Hi there! I need some help. Lately my depression has really been kicking my ass and I had a weekend trip for tomorrow to go visit some family in Boston. My mom and sis are going but having to fake a smile in front of relatives seems awful to me right now. Everyone is saying I should go and that I’ll cheer up once I’m there but it’s not like that. I’m not sad, I have depression it’s different and no one seems to understand that.|1
Like I have friends that I talk to everyday and my family is cool and I workout and exercise but I just break down cuz I’m fucking alone and can’t change a thing about it|1
Today I have been having a hard time of really giving my emotions a lot I just had a death in my family:/ my grandma past away on may 20 had funeral on the may 25, Iv really been struggling a lot my grandma is the world to me and it wasn’t the easiest death, I had so many memories with her and good time with and knowing she gone where I can’t physically give her a hug or tell her all about everything about what I have been up too it’s so mf hard bruh. I have been struggling with depression for a long time I really hate it and what makes things worse is when you are already so depressed and sad and have all these emotions going through and don’t know how to take it out ever really overwhelming for me and so I’m still processing the death of my grandma,if this kinda makes more understandable I was with my grandma that day before she past away when I found out she past my heart drop to the floor I was broken I had just lost my grandma:( knowing about 2 weeks to 1 week and half ago the doctors told us she seemed all okay and doing bette. but  then she literally end up going to emergency surgery and then the doctors telling us she only had lil time to live.so that when me and my dad drove about 10hrs to get there to be with her before her passing I got to see her and make sure I was there with her before her passing I loved her so much. What I’m saying what are some of ways on trying to process when loved one passes away? I need help I’m struggling I try to hide that I’m hurting but there a point where I break:( plz help I just need some ideas on helping me.:/|1
Does anyone else look at pictures of themselves as a little kid before they started getting a bunch of mental problems and just get so fucking sad? I can’t believe I used to have so much happiness and joy in me. I had dreams and aspirations. I was so innocent. Now I have depression, anxiety, crippling OCD and intrusive thoughts, and an eating disorder. I hate myself and I am a complete failure. I am trying so hard at life and it is kicking me down harder and harder and harder. It never fucking ends. It’s been off and on dealing with these things since I was like 12 (I’m almost 26F) and usually when one illness gets better, another gets 10x worse. I thought a few years ago when I went inpatient that was my lowest, but I have hit rock bottom more times since. I grieve for my past self. I have let her down. I never should have been born.|1
We used to be one of them. And now I'm just so paralyzed by this. I went to the doctor the other day. Told him I had depression. He agreed after hearing my symptoms. He gave me some medicines. But they've been making me more anxious than I was before. I just can't get stuff done. AT ALL. The last time I sat down to study, I had a full blown breakdown and just cried for many hours. I'm so tired of all this.|1
This is something I thought about that I think we all, at least, react on a subconscious level and it isn’t positive, but maybe I’m confirming what I believe. I don’t really have any studies on this. :P|1
First thing I’m gonna do is go to the doctor and figure out what the hell is wrong with me|1
"It just keeps getting worse and worse. My social/party life used to be my escape from reality. Recently it’s just making it all worse. Worrying about what people think of me so much I can’t contribute to any conversation. This makes me more self conscious and quiet when I used to be so full of energy at parties. Recently a bunch of my “friends” like 15 of them.. went to a big trip together and I never got an invite or mention of it. I feel so excluded. I’ve realized I’ll never be that person that everyone is excited to see or hang out with. I’ll be the charity case friend. It’s tough... seeing all your friends together having a great ass time w/o you and not even taking your into consideration at all. 

I have a shitty personality. I know it. In bitchy and complain a lot because well I fucking hate my life. But overall I thought I was fun I mean everyone complaina sometimes? I guess that’s not the case.

Now I’m just a boring person w substance abuse issues and depression. Where tf do I go from here"|1
Any advice would really help me.|1
I have to vent about this to someone so might as well do it anonymously online to strangers... In Sep 2019 I was at a friends house with my 4 year old daughter. That friend had a 5 year old so we had a sleep over. My friend and I drank while the kids were playing.. After the kids fell asleep was when we got drunk. The next morning she had to go to work and wouldnt give me and my daughter a ride home even though she knew i had been drinking and couldnt drive. She literally told us we had to go and she was stressed and angry. So.. I had my daughter and I in the car and I was calling her dad to pick us up and he wasnt answering.. It had been an hour and were parked on a busy road and a cop comes up to the window and asks if I had been drinking. I said no.. He breathalyzes me and I blew positive.. I wasnt driving and i was parked in my car with my daughter waiting for someone to pick us up.. Since i was in drivers seat with keys in my hand and my child in the backseat I was given a 2nd DUI and I got a felony child endangerment. Mind you.. This whole time I was NOT even driving and I had no desire or intention to drive especially with my daughter! Now im on felony probation and I am so stressed and depressed and its hard to even focus on my daughter with all the never ending incessant commands and demands of probation and how they tell you what to do and order you around and watch your every move, and threaten you constantly for flinching is driving me nuts! Sorry had to vent.. Lay it on me whatever you have to say|1
I really don’t know how to describe how I feel. I’ve never felt so low in my life. My boyfriend and I met early this year, we fell deeply for each other. We spent every moment together or on the phone talking. He was my world. I can’t wake up without thinking of him, everything I do I think about him, he dominates my brain 24/7. He broke up with me to focus on his battle of depression and anxiety, which I totally understand. But at the same time it feels like my heart was ripped out of my chest. I just wish I could have made him happier|1
"I come here a lot when I'm down, post a rant, try to show some support to you. This time I'm feeling better and I wanted to share it with you as well.

I'm still new to this world of depression, not really sure what I'm actually dealing with, but I get ups and downs. For a couple of weeks now I've been neither, but not better: I was numb, barely functioning, but past suffering or trying.

Two days ago I suddenly felt the need to cry over my grandpa and cousin who passed away this year, and something opened up. I found a safe place, cried and cried about them and my life and everything I can be and I'm not, literally talking to myself and the world untill I was finished. I walked out still carrying the weight, but I felt stronger.

It's only been two days, and it wasn't perfect since, but it's... refreshing. I do and I try and I'm present in my own little way. 

I don't trust this fee;ing very much. I know myself and I trip and fall all the time. But it's nice for now. I hope you find something to help you as well."|1
"will this feeling ever stop? will i stop hurting myself and my loved ones? will i learn to let go?  
i want to end it all so badly, knowing that i dont have the balls to do it just makes it worse  
i hope someone reads this. i really need to feel loved right now, i feel im at my lowest point and that im never getting up from this. i just feel so hopeless"|1
Im fuckin done man. I wake up and there's just so much pain everyday as soon I wake up, staring at the ceiling lying there.....I want the day to be over within minutes of waking up. It'll never end.|1
"I don’t even know who I am anymore. I get so lost doing things and to know it’s all ultimately meaningless. I get these headaches...there’s just nothing left and I’m so fucking tired of being this way. Of pretending like everything’s fine. I hate it all I just want it all to go away. 

I have to act or I’ll just end up suffering for nothing, rotting slowly..bc I don’t belong here and I shouldn’t be alive bc I’m empty. I see no value in any of it and I feel as if I’m becoming more distant as time progresses and I can’t stand it"|1
"Im (38M), unemployed, autistic, have depression and anxiety.

My life just feels pointless at times like this. It feels like I have nothing in life...one of my friends moms even told me i have nothing. It feels like killing myself would be a good way out of the mediocrity of my life.

I feel like im going to be alone forever, having lost all my potential for building a great life.

I had so much promise in my youth, but i just feel a bit useless now with no hope.

Idk, im having a low moment but when i think like this it feels like im seeing the truth of my life.
I didnt ask for this kind of life and i dont want it."|1
I wish i was consistently depressed. i’ll have these highs where i feel SO happy, literally like i was never depressed. Then a few days later here I am feeling like shit and crying in my bedroom wishing i was back at the high|1
"This is just a vent, as I feel so alone....so tired of having to vent to people in my life.  Pushed most of them away, honestly, and the ones I am still friends with, I try my best to not overwhelm them with my depression.  It gets better, then it gets worse...but really, I just feel like I'm running in circles.  Life isn't progressing, but actually regressing.  Im losing more and more of the will to try each cycle of depression.

Maybe it just feels that way.  Recent relapse into self medicating...didn't last long, but now I'm just freakin so tired of trying.  I know I can't get high, but also know that sobriety is lonely, even when I'm around people.  Hate to admit it, even to myself, but I sometimes wish things would just end.  Like what am I even fighting for?  A day where I don't wanna die? Its been years.  I've tried it all.  There are objectively good things in my life but they don't bring me happiness...joy...nothing.  

When these days hit hard, its hopeless.  I wanna just give up and crawl in a hole and be alone...just so noone can see how depressed I am.  How worthless I feel.  It doesn't make sense to them because like I said, objectively I have an OK life...better than most I would assume.  But im lonely.  None of it matters if I am so alone in it.  I miss having that one person that cared...that truly cared...but I pushed her away too.  Boo hoo...poor me...I know.  But its a slowly dissipating and painful existence that, today, I just wanna give up.  I won't, and wouldn't do anything to hurt myself, but I dont know why.  I guess I just need to take some time to refocus on reasons for living and hope one gives me the strength to try again."|1
My life’s already fallen apart. I’ve lost everything. I have terrible luck on top of being a constant failure. My only redeemable trait is my heart and it’s the thing torturing me day after day. I’m not built for this stupid world. My mind is broken and I’m done pretending|1
Like nature is looking out for me or something by making me suicidal rather than trying to live a long life with this disorder. I'm so depressed again I can't think clearly and I feel like I have the flu. I've tried to kill myself by overdosing so many times and come close twice but this time I am looking for a more permanent way. I am cutting myself again. I just don't deserve to live, I'm a terrible person and for world really would be better off without me.|1
I feel like a fraud every time I even mention it to anyone even here , I talked to a school counselor about me missing so much and she told me that I'm just seeking attention but I think its just so the school does not have to mark me as legal absent or am I just justifying my own behavior,  I just really wish I could go to sleep and live out my dreams there forever .|1
"Everything is just so overwhelming. It's all too much. I don't know how else to put it. 

Mania gets me in trouble and could ruin my life one day. OCD ruins my hobbies and passions. The guilt from my past reopens wounds never being allowed the gift of healing. Everyday, I relive it. I'm behind on school work. I feel like a burden to my friends. It's so hard for me to love because of my mental issues. I punish myself as a way to cope with guilt. I lost interest and motivation in everything that I enjoyed. My future is bleak, filled to the brim with anxiety and fear of what's yet to come. I'm a shell of my old self. I have never been the same since this all started. All of this combined plus more is just relentless and a teeth grinding struggle. It feels like chains are holding me back from being myself. Being happy.

I just don't know what to do. I have considered suicide at multiple times during these past few months, but I never tried it. I just know I wouldn't be able to do it. I just know. There is the part of me in there... The REAL me, who wants to live. Wants to help others. Wants to love. Wants to make music. I want to live. I am happy with who I really am. But this empty, dead man walking that I am now? I can't recognize the mirror anymore.

Oh well. I'll just lay in bed and listen to music untill I fall asleep... Knowing tomorrow will be the same struggle as today. Just a little easier or a little worse. Rinse and repeat. Again, again, and again. I wish my dad was still alive. I think he'd understand my feelings right now.

I just wish this would all go away. Just one day I'll wake up and it's gone because I really can't take much more of this soul suffocating torture.

Would anyone like to talk for awhile? It's lonely at night. I'll admit, it's way better than the day."|1
I apologize if it turns out to be a long post, but I just feel like I need to write this out somewhere and maybe someone will read it and possibly help another person not feel more and more like someone who is losing a hold of themselves. I'm feeling things start to fall apart around me and more and more I'm not caring about it anymore when I know I should but the drive to fix or correct these broken paths is going away from me. I'm not feeling joy in life anymore. And what moments that does give me some happiness gets overwashed by all the other negative aspects my life that I can't even feel contempt with life. Financial responsibilities, personal health, relationships with friends and family is crumbling on me and I'm not caring anymore and I don't know why I'm letting it fall apart I don't feel anything. Its like suicide without the act of death itself. I know I need to fix it, but I honestly don't know how anymore. I'm so tired.|1
"I got laid off two months ago. I actually worked all through the pandemic and some crazy hours at that (at one point I pulled a 96hr week). I have severe CPTSD and depression and anxiety that I was just barely keeping veiled while working and working made all of it significantly worse. 

Now that I've had time to actually slow down and let myself fully feel things again, I don't even know how I'm gonna be able to function again and go back to work full time and the thought of having to eventually get off unemployment and waste away for 40+hrs a week again genuinely makes me want to just end it

I just can't even see the point in life if all I'm doing is barely holding myself together to give up my healing and health and happiness to hemorrhage my time and energy into a job I don't care about, be given 2, maybe 3  days of rest a week if I'm lucky. Like I seriously can't imagine how hard life is going to get for me when I'm not only having as many flashbacks as I'm having now, but I'm having them at work and people are judging me, my work performance is suffering and I have no option but to stay there because otherwise I'll be homeless and starve."|1
Today was hard for me. I was all alone. I felt so empty inside. I don’t have many friends, but the few I do have couldn’t be reached when I wanted to talk. I feel like they are never there when I need them, yet I am there for them.|1
Recently, there's been a lot of major life situations. It should take me some time to grieve what was and what could have been. Even if some of those changes are arguably for the better. It will take me a fair bit of time to adjust and to heal. I am going to feel hurt and overwhelmed sometimes because that’s a normal response. Universe, if ever I'm chasing the wrong things, please realign me.|1
the way i can’t talk about how i’m feeling to anyone kinda makes me want to stop talking to everyone tbh|1
"My kidneys swim in  pee 24/7 filtering out my blood, never complain


My intestines have to deal with my shit, literally, all day every day and probably have the worst job in the body, never complain


My liver is handling all the poison I put into my body, and I am sure has to work overtime every other weekend or so, but it never complains


But my brain, that little shit, lacks a bit of serotonine and goes : THE END IS NEAR, TIME TO DIE

I mean come on brain, be  a team player, stop constantly telling the rest of the body we are out of energy, and make us tired all day, till it is time to sleep and suddenly we are wired af and we won´t be able to sleep for hours.  And while we try to fall asleep it takes a stroll down memory lane, and reminds us of the one time in 8th grade when we embarrassed ourselves in front of the whole class. WHY ?? We had completely forgotten about it for so many years. I mean sure we cannot sleep, but is overanalyzing something for the next 2 hours that happened over 20 years ago  really a good use of our time ??


Sorry had a bit of a rough night and needed to vent. I am sure you all can relate to this. Why are our brains such toxic trolls ??  Should have gotten  a refund and bought another one when the warranty was still fine, but of course it worked fine back then."|1
I'm just not good enough for anybody and I'll never be good enough I'm not funny enough I'm not interesting enough I'm not smart enough I'm not good looking enough I'm not enough of anything and there's nothing I can do about it because I'm screw up and I screw everything up I thought I found someone who loved me but I screwed it up like i do everything soemtimes I wonder if the best thing I can do is just put a bullet in my head but I'd probably screw that up to and become an even bigger burden on the people I care about I just don't see any point in it anymore when all I do is screw things up and burden other people with me existing|1
I just spent the last 15 minutes, staring out of my window in the roof of my house, contemplating whether it would kill me or not, and wondering what I’d have to go through if it didn’t kill me. I seriously fear that I’d act on it, given more time. ... I just wanted to share it somewhere I would be anonymous from people that know me. My apologies.|1
"I don't know what to say. There's not enough words to convey how I'm feeling, what I'm thinking. There's not enough and yet I feel like I'm saying too much just from venting. I feel like I need to do better at bottling up everything so I can have a normal conversation without it leading to pessimistic views. Nothing's going to help. I'm done with meds, I'm done with therapy. I'll just sink into deeper silence, so no one has to deal with a broken burden like me.

So, yeah. Already said too much. 

*Insert words here*

I want to go back to bed."|1
"Context: She is 19 years old and I'm 20 years old. We have been dating for 17 months, but we have been friends since middle school. We're both in college, with no jobs and living with our respective guardians.

Sorry, this is long and English is not my first language so there might be mistakes...

So, my girlfriend is depressed. She has been for a long time. She has a diagnosis and she takes meds for that and for her anxiety. Of course, I cannot 100% understand what she is going through, but I think it's important to add that I've also been depressed before (sometimes when I am having a really really bad mental health day I self harm, but I am mostly ok). Thus, I kinda have some idea of that the experience is.

As a result of her depression and anxiety, she has few friends. I am the only person she talks with regularly, apart from her mom. I think that doesn't help her situation, so sometimes when I go out with friends I take her along (and she does enjoy herself - it's not like she doesn't like talking to people, it's just hard for her).

We don't live near each other, so I only come to visit her two weekends every month. Due to \~current events\~, we can't really go out. We just stay in her home and play videogames, watch stuff on youtube or netflix, the usual stuff. We text really often, and I always ask how she's feeling. She doesn't usually tell me outright that she's sad, but every day she answers with one word: ""tired"".

I know this sucks for her. She dropped out of college two times in the last two years, because she couldn't stay motivated enough to attend classes, do homework, studying and so on. This year she is trying again, but I know that she is struggling, even though she doesn't communicate it. I get it, online classes have been hell for most people, including me, so take that and add the depression and it's normal to have a hard time with school work. But I know that if she fails her classes again it will make her feel even worse, especially since she really cares about what her parents think of her.

She either sleeps too little or way too much, which means she is always feeling tired. She struggles with taking care of herself sometimes, and she will often just spend all her day inside her room scrolling her phone with all the lights off. Again, I don't think that helps her situation, but I get feeling too unmotivated to step out of bed.

Something else that doesn't help her case at all is that she's trans, and she hasn't come out to her parents yet. Even though she wants to transition, she feels too scared and anxious to do so, and well, I understand that. I support her to the best of my ability, but I can't help but feel like she would be happier if she could actually be herself, you know? Every time I manage to get some cash, I bring her nail polish, perfumes, lipstick - things I think she will like. And yeah, she wears them in secret when her mom isn't home. I know it isn't enough though. I wish I had the money to rent a place far away so that she could transition and live as herself, but I can't (yet).

I know that she has tried therapy in the past, but she stopped going. I have suggested ""hey you should try it again"" but she always says it's too expensive and she would feel guilty asking her parents for money (so I offered to pay it for her... and of course she said she would feel guilty if I paid for it). Sometimes something bad happens at home and she has especially bad days. I feel grateful because she has always contacted me all those times and I stay with her on the phone until she feels a little better. I worry a lot though, because she has tried to kill herself three times in the past (before we were dating; though I was her friend then, I didn't find out as she wasn't noticeably injured and didn't tell anyone about it).

Today her mom sent me a message saying she was concerned because she noticed she has been ditching her classes. Even asked me to ""talk some sense into *him*, because I don't know how to make *him* understand that this is about *his* future"". I won't even reply to her, really. Like, I just keep thinking about how the whole situation is so unfair. I know my girlfriend is an adult, but I feel like we're back in middle school, when we were both depressed teenage boys who were in pain and no adult around seemed to notice or care. Like, did her mom just straight up give up on her and expects me to... do what exactly?

I talked to her today, as I do every day, and she told me she was fine but tired. I won't press her to tell me about how school is going, if she is struggling and wants to share it, she will. She is not stupid, she is one of the smartest people I know. It's not that she doesn't understant this is about her future, it's that she has trouble even imagining there is a future out there for her.

I am the only one who knows about her suicide attempts, I am the one who's there to comfort her when she is crying, I am the one who helps her with her make up, I am the one who goes out to buy groceries for her when she does not feel like getting out of her house. I am the one who gets into email fights with her school's principal so that she is allowed to keep her hair long (the school has bs rules about ""men"" with long hair ugh). Fuck, I am the only person who calls her by her name. I feel like she should have much more support, or at least, the support of someone stronger than me.

I want to do more. I don't know what to do to help her. When I am there with her, I manage to make her smile and it brightens my whole day. She deserves to be happy and safe. She is brilliant and she deserves a career in which she can stand out for being so great. And yet, she is wasting away in her room, in a hostile world that makes her feel like there's no place for her.

I need some advice on what else could I do."|1
"So I got blood work done to make sure my heart is okay but they think its nothing to be worried about and bc I refused Ativan I’ll be getting an ect done on Tuesday and theyre going to put me on a waiting list for a psychiatrist 

My family doctor said he thinks I have severe depression and I was like idk I don’t think so bc I still function and I don’t have thoughts of suicide and he’s like your mind is on autopilot but your body isn’t and even if you think you’re not ignoring it you are that’s why your body is reacting with those symptoms it’s telling you that something is wrong and from what you’re telling me it’s at a severe stage especially if you started having panic attacks in august that have become everyday and some episodes last six hours you could really be messing up your heart that’s why your heart feels like like a pulled muscle 


I didn’t mention anything about depression or mental anything I just told him that I frequently have panic attacks atleast once a day and sometimes I break blood vessels in my face bc I can’t control my breathing how bad some of them are and that I thought sleep paralysis might be mini seizures and that my weight yoyos a lot and how my heart always feels like a pulled muscle and the last was that I can’t control my anger anymore and the tiniest thing makes me go into a rage where I literally can’t stop myself and I end up bawling while blacking out, over the dumbest inconveniences. 


I still never expected that depression could do this to you, I truly thought something was wrong with my heart and I was going to die soon because it’s been getting worse. I feel kind of dumb because can’t I just fix this myself? Like this shouldn’t be a problem I can fix this myself? I don’t want to burden anyone anymore with somethings that mental. It’s all in my head? Idk I just never thought I would be where Iam and I’m ashamed I let life get to me to this extent because I always thought of myself as a self healer."|1

My fiancé is everything to me. I’m 28 and I’ve known her since I was 14. We’ve broken up before but this time we worked everything out and we had a wedding date set and literally were planning trips and planning to live into in a week a new house yesterday. She said that it’s not because she doesn’t love me it’s because I can function for a long period of time. There were no indications she would break up with me it just came out of nowhere. We literally were planning our wedding the day before. I’ve been in a bad bout of depression lately and she decided she’s given me too many chances and I can’t function I guess. She didn’t cancel the wedding but she won’t see me she said I’m her kryponite. I can’t go on without her she’s my soul mate and always has been. She’s always believed in me and now she doesn’t. I have nobody else. I feel so helpless. My depression is just getting worse now|1
"These past few weeks have been crazy. I have a hard time going to school and i experience mania sometimes. It's pretty new so I don't have a diagnosis to explain it but what i do know is i have MDD, SAD, and ""BPD traits"" (everyone is fairly certain i have it but i can't get diagnosed until i'm 18). Last week I was manic, felt amazing and went to school everyday for the first time in a long time. Then this week comes and I can't even get out of bed. Missed the whole week of school. Mentioned something about suicide on Tuesday so the cops showed up. It's not a big deal because they come all the time. Just told me to suck it up and have my mom take me to the hospital. Same thing they always say. I told her not to take me because quite frankly i'm sick of getting guilt tripped over the medical costs. 

I really started trying this week after finally seeing my therapist for the first time (the one my mom was supposed to set up 6 months ago) i tried the stupid breathing techniques and i got dressed and took my dog for a walk. I was REALLY trying for the first time in a long time and i hate to say it but i was proud of myself. I haven't had my phone all week because that's what happens when i don't go to school. Even though it's mentioned in several safety plans that I need my phone to contact people if i'm feeling suicidal. thank god i have my laptop which is what i'm using now. she tried to take it Wednesday night and i swear i almost exploded. She didn't even buy it. I just kept bothering her until she screamed at me and gave it back. something along the lines of ""fine just ruin your life."" I'm used to her yelling so I really couldn't care, as far as i'm concerned these are life and death decisions for me.

 fast forward to today. She told me if I cleaned a corner of my room she would let me use my phone. I cleaned it and I was really happy. Then she said i had to clean the whole thing and that she never said the corner and that it was my fault cause i misheard her. I freaked out because i get super overwhelmed by cleaning my room. Eventually I turned on some music and just did it. I was so proud too. Like i really did all that. I passed out afterwards because that's what happens when you feel 100 emotions a day. She gets home and wakes me up and says ""I thought you were gonna clean your room?""

 It hurt so bad. How could she not notice or even be the tiniest bit proud of me? I told her I did and even showed her. Then once again she changes her story. now i have to scrub the floors and clean under the entire bed. I tried so hard all day to clean it and it still wasn't enough. Nothing is ever enough for her. I had a panic attack as she screamed at me about something (i covered my ears). I vented to friends, used breathing techniques, and every other coping mech i could think of. I was feeling a little better having just brought myself down from like a 10 to a 5.

 So I tried to reason with her. I told her i would scrub the floors tonight because the bed was really overwhelming and i was tired from working on it. Then she screamed at me about how I didn't do anything and that she does everything for me and how she was sick of me fighting with her. I just feel so useless 24/7. No matter what I do it's never been enough and it never will be. 

We were supposed to spend this weekend together as a family, and by family I mean me, my 9 year old sister, my mom, and my abusive alcoholic step dad who my mom was stupid enough to start seeing again. I can barely stand both of them when I have my phone to distract me. I wouldn't stand a chance without one. So now I get to be home alone all weekend. I was supposed to meet my nephew and see my brother who I haven't seen in years. He was the only one there for me when things with my stepdad got really bad. I probably won't see them for years now. This was a lot i'm sorry. I just really want to be enough."|1

i am a teenager growing up in the social media age. im constantly comparing myself to people around me and models on social media. it’s gotten so bad that i can’t even be myself. even with my friends, i think thoughts “why don’t i have long legs like hers?” “she has such beautiful arms.” these thoughts are starting to ruin me. ive hated my appearance since 8th grade. high school shattered my vision of my self completely. i can’t even go into a dressing room without shutting down. i constantly am checking my appearance. sucking in my stomach. standing up straight. anything to look more skinny. anything. ive wasted so many opportunities with relationships and fun times with friends because of my ideas of myself. i liked this guy for a year. he was perfect for me. i didn’t pursue anything with him because i thought i was too ugly and fat to be seen with him. i am now a junior in high school. i haven’t worn feminine clothing in at least 2 years.every dress I’ve worn was me forced to wear something nice. i dont post pictures. every picture teaken of me gives me anxiety that i look disgusting. my best friends are so beautiful and skinny. i went shopping for prom dresses with them today. i can not describe how shit i felt the entire time. i felt like they hated me. i couldn’t stand them looking at me. i felt so disgusting. ive felt so numb looking in that mirror. i feel like i will never find love because of my appearance. i have had self harm thoughts. one day i was unloading the dishes, and i was putting away our kitchen knives. i started bawling my eyes out. i just wanted to shape my body into what i believe is beautiful. i want it to be over. i want to be able to wear what i wish i could. this isn’t even all of what i feel. i know im not alone in this. but i feel like i am.|1
I've been struggling mentally about life in general. My uncle past on which he was like a father to me because my dad left when I was extremely young and died never being able to meet him. Before he pasted away me and him weren't at best of odds but I know he loved me but it still hurts nonetheless. I'm graduating from high school officially this week and I decided to join the navy but I think it might make my mental health worsen instead. I got plans on what I want to do with my life but I have so much anxiety I can't push myself to do it. Constantly saying I want to go home but why? I'm already home or am I? I had a weird dream the other night and it really scares me in which I commit suicide... I don't know if it's a sign or I'm overthinking things like I always do. But life happens but why was I given the rotten egg? What's funny is that I'm the only one out of my generation (my sisters and I) that haven't went to the mental facility so I guess it runs in the family. I also think that my childhood may have influenced this mental health because of my other siblings feeling the same. Should I just let Jesus take to wheel and hope he got it(I'm not even religious lol)  but I've tried to keep myself from thinking suicidal thoughts by watching tiktok, movies, youtube, and games so I'm good till I go to sleep and of course have insomnia and just stare at the ceiling and think.|1
"the title. i'd been doing better, but this hit me harder than i thought. actually the whole family--except one brother, who did remember. oddly i don't even care that much about birthdays, but being forgotten still really stings - especially since it feels like its just one more nail in the coffin of my family's relationship, which has been slowly falling apart since my mom died and dad remarried. which, i'm actually genuinely happy that he found someone and isn't alone--but it seems like bit by bit, as he's gotten more in the routine of his ""new"" family, he's forgotten that it's not as easy for his adult kids to find someone to fill in the gap in the same way he did. 

anyway. it just reminds me again how there's no one who i could really reach out to if shit really got bad. which is ironic because realizing that is itself something that makes me want to reach out to someone. and to think i'd been feeling less depressed...... thanks birthday."|1

I used to have this white hot ball of rage inside that gave me unbelievable strength and confidence but… This past year i’ve struggled heavily with depression. It’s sapped all of my energy and confidence. I feel drained and exhausted, and I have no energy to be angry anymore and I feel weak and helpless without this anger to drive me and give me strength. It’s driven me my entire life and I don’t know who I am anymore without it. I’m just sad and so goddamn weak now. I lost all confidence in my ability to tear people to shreds if they pissed me off, all I feel is sadness now. I don’t know how to go back to being the old me and regain the power this rage provided me. Any insight or opinions would be greatly appreciated.|1
"I'm not happy. I haven't been happy in a long time, probably even before covid. 

I don't look foreward to ANYTHING anymore. 

I haven't had friends in a long time. I can confidently say that if I turned off my phone for a week, I would have absolutelly no messages, no one knows I exist or care. 

All my life right now is going to work, the gym, and back home. People say, ""go socialize more."" Well, with who? I've had over a year of quarantine isolation to ""learn to love myself alone,"" and it didn't help at all. 

I can't relate to anything I see on social media or in person, with groups of friends hanging out, having fun. I haven't experienced that in years. I don't know what it's like to have a group of guy friends to call ""the boys,"" because I have never had a group of guy friends. 

I'm also 22 and have 0 dating experience. I know they say you shouldn't date when you are depressed/not in a good place mentally, since it will be too much of a burden on the other person, but I fear I am too far gone to recover and be in a good place mentally where I could have a girlfriend. I also dread everytime I remind myself I wasted all those years not getting any dating experience while everyone else did, never experiencing teeange or college romance. And seeing anyone my age in relationships makes me so sad about myself. I've never experience that and may never will. I am so starved for companaionship, I just want someone to hug me and tell me everything will be ok. And I feel like I missed my chance. 

This fall classes are back in person. And I realize I have zero friends to live with. How great is that? Years of college all to just end it by living alone your senior year, and having no one to come back to. 

I am literally a shadow, an NPC, just empty space. 

If i died, my parents would be sad, maybe some people I know from school would be said too, if they found out a few weeks later. 

I feel like my depression and lonliness has also aged me faster. Everyone says I look way older than my age, and that makes me feel ugly. 

Every friday night I am just left alone in my bedroom. Sometimes I go for a walk, and see other people in their friend groups, and just wonder, ""whats that like?"" 

Whats the point of continuing on? Why should I keep going to the gym? No one cares about how I look. Why should I keep working 5-6 days a week? All that money is going to a shitty appartment in college this fall. Why should I try socializing? Everyone will just think I'm a creep in public. 

I know it is not normal for a 22 year old to feel this way. I know it is not healthy at all. At 22 you are supposed to be full of energy and excitement, looking foreward to the future and fun things, have lots of friends, have lots of fun memories, and generally be happy most of the time. I am rarley happy these days. I want to feel happy again. 

Maybe I will make friends this fall at college. Maybe I will get a girlfriend. Maybe I will look foreward to things again. Maybe I will have fun experiences. Maybe I will be someone on the field instead of someone on the sidelines. But I am legitimately worried I will not make it that far. I don't know if I can survive much longer living this way. I hope I can."|1
"My dad broke my guitar cause I didn't listen to what he said. Isn't the first time I disobeyed him. It's fine I caused his reaction and I should be punished for it.




Update: He apologized."|1
"Random 14 year old on reddit here. I tried to make this sound as not edgy as possible.

I feel like I'm getting worse since my dad told me he had diabetes and he smokes so I know his death will be right around the corner for him. He's 39 now, who knows how much longer he's got left. I can't help but notice the wrinkles on my moms face, she is so stressed and over worked that you can see it on her face now. I can tell she is trying to have a good time and forget about the past like me. My dad is constantly raining hell fire on her though. He literally told his side of the family lies about her and now she is hated so much. I can't talk to my dad about it either. I can't force myself to be angry at him, he's always telling me how I never tell him I love him. And that's my problem, for some reason I can't tell my dad I love him and I don't know why. 

I've screwed things up big time. My mom sacrificed her own dreams and life to make sure I live the best one. She wears the same clothes every day. The same sweatpants and shirt that she has been wearing for 2 years. I went to put up her laundry one day and her clothes were so worn out from working that you could see through the fabric now. She is losing hair fast and her teeth. I just know she misses being young. I can tell by the way she dresses. She wants to be young again, who doesn't? So I try to hype her up when she wears her teen clothes when she is 40. She has gotten so skinny and lost all her weight while she starves. She cooks for us every meal. Leaving none for herself. I encourage her to eat but she goes to our garage to smoke a cigarette instead and never eats her meal that she made. It just tears me apart when I look at her sleeping. It makes me realize how tired she is from keeping our family of 7 together. I want to give her the world.

My little brother has some sort of speech disorder and can't say stuff right so it makes it hard to understand him. I really do feel like he's asking for help but just can't say it. He's always crying and watching his iPad when he starts crying for absolutely no reason at all. He's really skinny too. My whole family is, we are poor and starving.

Social media absolutely demolished my life the moment I downloaded tiktok. I started to compare myself to others. Just like my mom warned me about. What really hurts me is that I said I would never ever download social media when I was 12 but here we are now. I downloaded tiktok and it stole my mind and made choices for me. I couldn't form my own opinion without being bombarded by 'alt emilys' and 'da boiz' so I just followed the trend. I deleted snapchat and tiktok after all that shit. Glad to say I've never turned back and took a sneak peak at what's going on in tiktok. Thank god.  
\---The music I listen to hits different now. Literally.  
\-Metal doesn't make me feel like a badass anymore, It makes me feel emotions.  
\-Dubstep doesn't make me feel like I'm fighting robots anymore, It makes me feel a shit ton of nostalgia.   
\-House music doesn't make me feel like I'm at a party anymore, It makes me feel guilty.  
I hate it like this. Instead of imagining cool ideas and concepts in my mind while I listen to music, I focus on the lyrics and understand what the meaning of the song is. I cry every time I listen to a song that reminds me of something. And I was obsessed with metal when I was 10-13 but now at age 14, I can't listen to it without thinking about something sad.

\---The places I wanted to go to have changed.  
\-Living in a futuristic city? I want to more 'Escape' to a futuristic city now.  
\-Traveling to Tokyo, Japan? I want to run into a forest and live there now.

Everything is now about escaping to places alone and traveling while I'm still alive. I feel so rushed to do everything I wanted to do. I'm getting older and it seems like time is flying by so fast compared to the last 2 years when I was like 12. I've always thought it was just a thing to do with age, the longer you've been alive, the shorter time seems because you've experienced more of it. I can only imagine how fast time will fly by when I'm around 24 when I hopefully graduate from college and begin traveling. I just want to get everything done as soon as possible before I'm too old to even walk.

Most of my best memories come from summer 2019. It's almost summer and I'm already getting hit hard with tons of nostalgia. I can't go an hour without thinking about the past. Literally, every hour I think about stuff I miss. My mind is all over the past. I wish I could go back honestly.

When I was 12, I wasn't thinking about the future at all, not once. I was focused on looking good for everyone and fitting in. At 13, I was thinking about the future and what I could do to live the happiest life ever. At 14, now, I am rather hopeful than excited. I hope I can travel. I hope my friends stay with me. And I'm 14, that's still young. I feel like I shouldn't be worried about the future so much at this age to be honest.  
\-I used to draw a shit ton of stuff, now I quit drawing.  
\-I used to do track and cross country in 7th and 6th grade, now I'm losing all my muscle and weight  from sitting around all day.  
\-I used to go outside more in 5th grade, now I'm indoors 10 hours during daylight, all night during night. Only about 30 minutes a day while I go outside.  
\-I cleaned my room almost weekly, now I have a huge pile of dirty clothes in the corner of my room, Trashcan is over full of paper and schoolwork, Paper towels and cleaning supplies left out from a few weeks ago when I tried to clean my room.  
\-I used to eat 3 meals a day and a few snacks, now I'm eating 1 piece bacon almost everyday for breakfast, Takis as my only snack everyday, and dinner. That's only 1 full meal.  
\-I used to pet my cats everyday, 1 died a year ago, 2 went missing 11 months ago and were never found, 1 went missing 5 months ago, 3 got killed by my neighbors dog, 1 died on my lap (literally). Yeah, I had a shit ton of cats. And now I'm slowly forgetting about them.   
\-I had 3 dogs a while ago, 1 got ran over, 2 got eaten by other dogs.  
Not to sound edgy or anything, but it really does feel like I can't escape anyone's death, my moms 2 friends died who were very close like almost family to me, my uncle got sent to prison and died.

Someone tell me if this is normal, or at least what age this happened to you if it did. I feel like I shouldn't be this worried about the future at age 14. I know it's good to be aware and all that but this feels so excessive. And the nostalgia. I already know the nostalgia isn't normal for me. I mean like every damn hour I'm always missing someone or something from the past. Literally everything I do now is always reminding me of the past and it makes me cry at embarrassing times.

Thank you for listening,

COVID cases are going down, things are starting to open back up: I’m ready to catch up with old friends and hang out. Only problem: not one of them wants to. Some people I text them, but they don’t text me back. Others act like they want to hang out but are flaky AF and keep canceling at the last minute. This isn’t a new occurrence either, it’s been happening my whole life. At some point everyone I’ve considered a friend winds up ditching me. I like to think I go through life being nice to others, but what’s the point? Truth is everyone is still the same judge mental piece of shit they were when they were 15.|1
No matter what I do and how happy I am I can't help but think that this is all for nothing. The planet is doomed no matter what I do. My life means nothing and no matter how nice I am or how I try to be, life is not worth it. I could live with knowing that life has no meaning, or knowing that my purpose is to be nice, or to be cruel, but the not knowing, it drives me insane. Not to be dramatic. But fuck. I hate that I make efforts knowing that there is no certainty. I try to be happy not knowing, but I always go back to wanting to be dead when these thoughts come back. I feel like reality is fake. We act like life is a blessing, but it's just false hope. I just want to understand. Why am I here? To kill myself? To feel happiness for one moment and then turn to suidical thoughts the next? What is reality? No one will tell me. Fuck|1
"So at school I ‘failed’ my Spanish listening test(I do Spanish B at IB, if u know what that is) and I put air quotes around failed cause technically I know it’s not an actual fail cause all the listening, reading, writing and speaking exams at the end of term get added up but still. He showed us the markscheme after the test ended and I saw how many I got wrong. 

Now I feel like I failed at life and I’m never gonna amount to anything. Then from that I started thinking about my future and how nothing makes me happy, so then what’s the point of doing this? To get into a good university and study a course that also makes me unhappy? 

Idk I know that it’s only one test and one part of my mind is telling me to just do well on the other two tests (for Spanish I have reading and writing left) but there’s also the part of my mind that’s telling me how I’m going to fail Spanish. 

God I wish I had a time machine or I could just travel back in time to before the test."|1
I hate myself. I really do. This is why I don't want to tell her, I don't want her to see me in pain. So, I'll hurt myself without anyone knowing.|1
losing my mind, every time it gets to a weekend i convince myself “i’ll ring up my doctor on the monday to tell them about my anxiety and depression” - knowing they ain’t open for 2 days (3 this bank holiday) and by the time it gets to it i won’t because i convince myself i was being dramatic the following friday. my mental state is so bad i constantly think about just ending it because it’s easier, although i know i won’t because i’d feel like a burden - this being because the amount of anxiety i have makes me feel that way ! anyone ever been in the same situation and just bit the bullet? what made you do it? at this point i feel like the worst will have to come before i seek professional help.|1
"Every day that I wake up I remember the sadness around me. The agony of a homeless man, the loss of a brother, drugs, violence, politics, a cruel reality so full of hope where every single person I grow to care for can die. A life where I watched my father grow into something he hated to the point of suicide, an experience where every negative feeling is monumental and the positivity has died, an existence where my grandfather will forget me before he dies, a life where I want to help everyone but can't even help myself. 

Why do I keep going? To make others happy?
To bring solace to those who hurt? To experience a joy that doesn't exist? Why doesn't trying help?
To prevent my family and those I love and cherish from suffering when I cannot stop my own? What brings me joy? Why do I wear a masked face to make others comfortable? 

I have a million different questions and the stresses that accompany them. I feel that nothing I do is acceptable. Every action I take is scrutinized by my mind. Every feeling I have is blurred by the past and the suffering I've seen. Every thought is biased to hate myself or take away my joy. The way I overthink and criticize every detail and every pore of my character makes me feel so sad but it's the only thing I have to cope with my stress. 

I've tried to get help but I cannot trust the people around me to be understanding and the therapists I've seen don't care.
I know I need to change my mindset somehow and my environment paired with the intensity of my empathetic infliction makes that feel outside of what is realistically possible. If only I could stop myself from thinking about the pain, I could change. I know what I want, I know how to get it, but I also know how I'll feel because I am a creature of habit. 

This could've been a suicide note if I was able to hurt people that way; but I've seen the fractures that would cause and don't want those to be my last thoughts. 

I'm sorry if I made you empathize

I’ve been battling a deep spat with my depression lately and it’s mainly to do with the fact that I didn’t have a job for 6 months because of the pandemic and lots of other people in Search of who where in the same position and was being almost fully financially supported by my boyfriend which was really hard on him during this time I had a seasonal job that I got for the holidays because the were in desperate need but wasn’t kept on after the holidays and so was once again without a job and depending on my boyfriend and it made me feel so horrible and still does after a couple more months I was finally able to get a temp position at a retail place with the chance of a full time position and I really thought I enjoyed it there but when time came for them to choose who gets the full time position an out side hire was brought in and because I put so much faith in that position I had to scramble to find another job on top of trying to get back into school and nothings going right with that because I got scared and waited to long to get my application and all the documents they needed in for this coming fall semester also found out I need to take a assessment test before I can start as well and they want it before my application can be finished because my act scores were out of date and so now I’m just sad and feel almost like a empty pit in my chest because I messed up but there is one positive and it happened today I no longer have to worry about the job part because I was given a offer to one of the jobs I applied to this week and I’m sorry if I have ranted to much I just wanted to write this all out somewhere and maybe get some perspective from others reading this I’m not the best at explaining how I feel or the best way to explain what going on in my life|1
"Hi. Im 30. My girlfriend is 33 and she suffers mayor depression. We have been dating for 5 years or so.  
A couple of years ago she had a really bad time. She started psicoanalysis and taking meds and things got better.
Last February she had a panic episode and since then she's been having a really though time. She have to start taking meds again and therapy.

I moved to another country and we are going to be apart for some months. She told me I should learn more about depression and anxiety so I can deal with this and we can support each other in a better way.
Her friends kind of abandoned her. She feels so lonely.
So Im here to learn. I wish someone could tell me where to look for good information online. Also any personal experience or advice can help me too.

Thanks in advance. And sorry for my English, not my native lenguage."|1
Quarantine has made everything worse in my life. The good things always are weighed out by the bad. The main one is my boyfriend. I met him in quarantine through school but I haven’t been able to hold him, or do anything of the sort, and it hurts. It’s been 9 months I’ve known him and 8 I’ve been with him, and I’ve only seen him twice. He was right in front of me and I couldn’t hug him, or anything. It’s getting old, missing him. Not that I don’t like missing him, I just wish I didn’t have to like this and I wish that he was here. I’d do anything and everything just to hold him. I’m so lost, and tired, and numb from all the pain of missing him. He’s my home, and I just wanna go home.|1
"I kinda get it... initially, seeing someone quit something they longed for vicariously robs you of any sense of well-being or pride for that person; depending on the degree of empathy of the observer. I think people should become more self aware. Just because someone dreamt of doing something for so long, get there, and then quit doesnt warrant disgust or negative judgement on them... It seems to be an inclination, ive felt it in myself, and have noticed it before in others when i see that happen. Ultimately, i believe that your life is yours to live, and you dont owe anything to anyone unless if they do something for you. I think people should have the freedom to choose. If youre not happy, then whats the point? Fuck the world, and live life on your own terms. If people dont accept you, you dont have to prove shit to them. Do what makes you happy, because youre the one whos going to go alone in that casket when you die. You bring nothing to your grave, except your physical, rotting body. Not your memories, not your accomplishments, not your desires, not your fears. Being a quitter isn't always a bad thing anyways, you shouldn't feel pressured to stick with something you don't like. Part of life is experimenting, finding yourself, and learning. If you don't like something, then whats the point of 'sticking it out'...? To prove how \*tough\* you are to others? to yourself? just why?

Edit: Obviously, quitting something you know you NEED to get done for the welfare of yourself or someone you truly care about isnt good, but if you objectively have the means to support yourself, and you arent shrugging responsibility off onto other people, what you choose to do with your life should be no one elses business.... I never judge someone for having a less than prestigious ""career"", or not having 'this' or 'that', i judge their character and actions. Does this person leech off other people? Does this person spread uplifting and positive energy onto others when they communicate, and if the persons depressed, does said person hurt those who are innocent? Treat others with politesse, dont assume you are better than them, and if you have nothing nice to say, be neutral, say nothing to them. If they disrespect you, all bets are off. Go ahead and treat them like shit then. Eye for an eye."|1

"I was basically raised to be the good child or perfectionist. If me and my two older sisters got bad grades, I’d get the most shit for it. My parents are kinda sexist so they expect the boy to be the smartest in the family so I had no room for fuckups. 

School wasn’t the best for me. On top of stress I got random insults thrown, especially in regards to my name bc it’s foreign and for some dumb reason American kids just love making fun of foreign names because it’s oh so funny... What a silly sounding name!

I had no real friends. I’m not talking about the “friends” that say “hey” to you once every five to ten business days. I almost always sat by myself at lunch.

Group projects weren’t the best either. Neither sports. Always got picked last. No one wanted me around so I ended up wanting no one around

Whenever my mood goes up, people are determined to bring it down. Somehow it always works because my self esteem is shit. I don’t like being happy anymore because when see i look visibly upset they tend to fuck off more often.

Good riddance.

I used to be a happy kid who spoke quite a lot and now I’m a bitter 19 year old who despises love and happiness. I don’t know what it is but the feeling of being nonchalant or unhappy brings a type of inner joy. Looking or feeling happy looks foolish to me now. Because I know it’s only gonna end in a minute when something bad happens.

Go ahead and get mad at this post all you want lol idc anymore. You all knocked the happiness right out of me"|1
I dont have any friends. No companionship, nothing. I'm at the point I'd hire a fucking prostitute just to have someone to talk too because nobody wants to talk to me.

"I'm in a loop every time I'm more aware of it now. 

I have a messed up sleeping habit.

I'm 25, I've been struggling to find a balance in my life. I have no significant relationships, my job is meaningless but it helps me get by, I'm a modern day slave. my family is completely dependable on me, I think my parents had it worse but probably are not aware of how bad their life was, (I hate to think in such a pessimistic way, but I can't lie to my mind, it's what goes through it) I'm rather tired of everything and I get very forgetful since the things I do normally lack meaning, I stay hopeful that I'll find meaning and comfort at some point, but time is not helping, it feels like hell, fast and slow simultaneously. I wish I could maintain the clarity I get from those moments of brief euphoria to see the bigger picture but yet again, it fades away. 

I don't know what else to put here.... I think that's all for now."|1

sometimes i’ll start crying when it feels like i’ve given myself a long enough pause to try to feel whatever this is.  and then it just stops.  and i go back to feeling nothing.  im trapped inside something i can’t see or feel and i would say that it scares me but.  

i don’t feel anything."|1

I just can't take this anymore. I'm sick of being lazy and doing nothing with my life. I keep trying to do stuff and be motivated, but I feel so tired all the time and my efforts lead to nothing. I'm really trying my best but it isn't good enough for this world. I keep getting delusional about reality and I keep telling myself the lie that my life is pointless and there's no hope for me.

"I know this may be an unpopular post, and that's OK. I count myself as one of the lucky ones. I've spent many years in Therapy and drug treatment for Major Depressive Disorder. I've had three serious suicide attempts where I've ended up in the ICU, and then had to stay 2-3 weeks afterwards in adult psyche. I'm obviously not bragging here, but trying to get across that I'm ""qualified"" to talk about this. Through treatment I feel a a lot better than I ever have in this stage of my life. I still have big episodes every 6 moths to a year, but that's amazing compared to what I used to go through everyday.

Here's what I want to talk about:

One of the biggest things I realized when I started therapy was that I secretly liked being depressed. I know it's the most horrible thing in the world, the crying, the thoughts of killing yourself, the days off work, in fact losing jobs because of it, losing friends and contact with family.

However, when I started therapy I worried for a long time that I would be ""cured"". I couldn't understand that feeling for a long time because I wouldn't admit to myself that over the years my depression had become a crutch. It was my reason for not facing life head on. It was my reason why things failed. It was my reason why my life was shit. 

It was also kind of comforting. I felt like no matter how bad things got, how stressful things became in my life or how badly I failed in my endeavors, I could always kill myself. It's hard to explain. As an example, I would stress and stress about something for hours, maybe something happening at work the next day. Some of us suffer from the ""looped thought"" thing as well, where we obsessively think and re-think the same terrible scenario over and over looping around every 5-10 minutes. I would do that for hours. Eventually I would catch myself and think, ""wait, this doesn't matter, because if it all goes wrong, I can come home tomorrow night and just kill myself"". Instantly I felt calmer and happier.

There are lots of other reasons why I felt comfortable having my depression and the thought of possibly losing it scared the crap out of me. Of course there is no outright ""cure"" for depression, so that was never really going to happen but I didn't know that at the time.

Anyone else willing to admit that depression might be a comfort thing? If not, then please tell us why :)"|1
I want to die, I want to fucking kill myself but I just couldn't. Sucks that i really find myself a coward when i attempt and find ways bc i couldnt commit.|1
"28 year old male here.

I'm having a bit of trouble expressing what my depression really is. To my therapist, my psychiatrist, my long-term boyfriend, hell even to myself.

I don't want to kill myself, I don't want to die, I just want to not be... me. 

My self-esteem and confidence is zero, but I put on a happy face. Unfortunately I'm funny, so when I finally express how I'm really feeling it always comes at a shock.

I can't take pictures of myself, I can barely look in the mirror, because I hate what I see. I was required to submit a picture of myself for university and literally had a panic attack.

I always give seemingly-accurate reasons about not posting anything on social media, and I finally came clean to my boyfriend that every reason I don't is because I can't stand myself, and to be honest, I don't think he understood. He's always been supportive of me and helping me get the help I need, but I don't think he is able to empathize rather than sympathize.

I have this self-disgust and self-hatred. I don't want to see myself in pain or hurt myself, I just don't want to see myself. 

I'm conflicted because one side of my brain I am able to logic my way out of some spiraling thoughts... (thanks CBT therapy) but the other is just so dark and unforgiving and unrelenting. 

I thought my meds were working, and I think they are. I think they finally allowed me to see this a bit clearer, but I've really struggling since.

The thing is - **I want to get better**. I want to be okay, and I just don't know how.

Anyone have any direction or things to think about?"|1
"Had a lot of stuff happen over the last 6 months that caused almost daily anxiety where my mind went into negative spirals. Then my mom came back into my life which started triggering PTSD from the past which caused more of a negative spiral. Also got hit by a car on my bike 2 weeks ago and have been experiencing really bad depression/anxiety/suicidal thoughts. Finally went to a psychiatrist today and he suggested Quetiapine 12.5mg because with my history of concussions he said SSRIs can be dangerous for mood swings. Was wondering what you guys thought. Any and all input would be greatly appreciated. 

PS I eat really healthy, exercise every day, take cold showers, CBD oil, in great physical shape just my mind is a mess."|1
"I’m surrounded by people who care about me, but I’m completely alone. I’ve tried opening up to my friends about how I’m feeling and they always change the subject or say “it’ll get better blah blah” and then distance themself. 

My family tries to be supportive but that consists of telling me to “stop being such a pussy and just snap out of it” or “if you’re so miserable just kill yourself already”. 

And I fucked up the only person in my life who did actually care (my ex girlfriend). My self-hatred and depression pushed her away and she won’t even talk to me. I’m completely alone and can’t handle it anymore."|1
I have depression and anxiety. Every relationship has gone south because of my rpoblems. I try to work on them, for me and for them, but I feel resentful, fights end up with me crying, and they can't follow my logic, and I give up. They say they love me ,but why do they say that when they're suffering so much and my emotions tug everyone back and forth and they're obviously unhappy? Why can't people just admit that I can't change? I've tried with drugs, therapy, exercise...I still cry alone in closets where I feel like I can write this, be myself, and finally love myself again for giving myself the space to just feel whatever. Like I don't have to legitimize every thought subject to scrutiny for people who care enough to try listen, and give up when I spiral. I just want to spiral in peace. I can deal with loneliness. It's better than hurting people unintentionally and having them lie and say they like And love me when I'm no good for them. I've accepted I'm trash and I love myself more when I do. And I am tired of calling myself trash. I just want to be Alone for the rest of my life. Otherwise I don't know how much longer I can wAke up being me and having that judged poked and prodded by people who say I don't make any sense. I've tried to make sense, and it only hurts. I've accepted I have no consistency in my brain. And I'm only hurting people when I try to explain myself. If I'm supposed to exist in this body, I want to take it far away where I can't hurt anyone but myself.|1
okay I’m probably not the first person to do this. But I’ve been masking all of my negative emotions and just building it up inside of me. I have no idea what to do with the emotion. I’ve only been telling people I’m happy, and I’m fine but that’s just a lie. I can’t show my tru emotions since I’m scared on people to say. I’ve always just put on a smile and a laugh. I always suppress my sadness even if it’s tearing me apart. I try my best to look normal but the emotions a leaking out now. I just don’t know what to do anymore.|1
I just can’t do this anymore|1
I have been in a depressive state for around 5 months. Bad, I know. That also means 5 months of eating garbage and not working out, and obviously gaining weight. I decided to work out with a personal trainer for the first time today. The first thing the trainer does is shame me about my weight gain and eating habits. Then, when I couldn’t do a workout he would point out how weak and out of shape I am, instead of switching to doing something easier. I am so frustrated because I feel like I have finally been getting back to my normal self and this guy has discouraged me from working out.|1
"I want to lose weight, I really do but I can't. I am lazy and I have junk food addiction, yes I feel like I am getting behind these reasons to justify my state but it's just how it is.

The main issue is that I don't want anybody to see me. Like, literally, I hide myself. I am ashamed of it. I lock myself in my room until everybody goes away. I look for rooms where I can be alone. When people calls me I don't go. When people takes a picture together, I don't go, even if people I like will be upset. I don't want to go out because people will see me. Around strangers I try to act like I am okay but I am not okay."|1
"fuck this im trying reddit

tw, sexual abuse.

i am going to therapy unpacking these experiences but i am still struggling greatly and recently felt very dismissed by someone i opened up to. they *disagreed* in my choice to remove myself from the family / speaking with my parents as i go through the healing grief and anger process.

my story has sexual and physical abuse content. 

My dad grabbed my genitals as a kid multiple times between the ages of 2-5... made fun of me / teased me / played some game by grabbing me and shaking / grabbing my dick and referring to them as “huevitos"" (spanish speaking fam)

the translation is significant, it indicates genitals, but ""tiny..."" he was making fun of me (shaming) ""haha, tiny little baby boy genitals"" and ""they can fit in the palm of my adult hand"" and the term makes explicit reference to the fact that I WAS A CHILD, compared with ""huevos""

i vividly remember him RECOUNTING THE ABUSE when i was older - he would say ""remember how i used to ""go like this"" and grab your huevitos."" 

i also can think of a time when i was older and he tried to grab me when we were in the kitchen and i flinched / spazzed out. ive been bullied all my life for being extremely jumpy, weak/skinny, and been called a ""spaz""

while looking up ""huevitos"" on google i saw porn w spanish descriptions come up. I broke down (lost my shit) when i saw that (recently - 4/4/21) because i felt for the first time that it was sexual abuse.

it was some form of ""teasing"" and i remember a couple instances of it when i was SUPER young - once standing up outside of their room and once when i was in his bed and i yelled at him to stop. 

my mom knew/saw it happening and told me it was my responsibility to tell him to stop *if it made me uncomfortable*

I remember yelling at him (throwing some sort of distressed tantrum) while he literally was doing it... i dont remember much other than that he was upset about the fact that i hated it.

i'm also aware we tend to block out traumatic memories like that so idk if my inability to remember all of it is from blocking it out.

i also have vivid imagery of him naked, standing up while i was sitting in front of a mirror. we were both naked and i have imagery of it but no context for it. my therapist says to remember the feeling from it... shame and hatred towards him.

when i was one on one with female teachers growing up (*before puberty*, sometime between 5-10) i would ideate about sexually kissing or touching them. ive read unwanted or inappropriate sexual thoughts at a young age are a symptom of sexual abuse.

my mother was overprotective, and any time i would sit on the couch or in a chair with my family, any time my hands would go towards my lap my mom would grab my hand and move it away. i got mad at her and asked her why she was doing that, she wouldnt say, and i internalized that i was gross or perverted because i thought that she thought i was touching myself. this was all way before puberty 😭😭

throughout childhood, dad often asked to ""crush"" us where he would suffocate / put his entire body on us in bed or on the couch as some form of showing him affection. 

he also frequently takes our dog into the bathroom and nobody in my family acknowledges it even though we all see him take her there. he just calls her over, in front of all of us, and she happily trods along. our dog has taken a symbolic role for me representing the childhood ME, and i see her (the dog) in my dreams now consistently CRYING.

one time when i was told i needed to watch her when i showered, i left the door open and tried to pee, and the dog kept going after my genitals after i kept pushing her away and telling her not to. i ended up pushing her out and closed the door, ashamed and mad that my parents told me i ""always"" had to watch her. my therapist says dogs dont do that unless they are trained or conditioned to 😭 so we can assume thats why dad takes her in the bathroom. 

he also very inappropriately pets her in a violating way on her stomach while her legs are spread eagle in front of us, while she is laying back ON TOP OF HIS CHEST. no one has every acknowledged or challenged this behavior 

im not recounting here any of the other narcissistic abuse patterns but we all had plenty of reasons to be afraid of him and his anger when challenged

the emotional / physical / sexual violation of me as a child and now of our dog makes me sick to my stomach and feel like my relationship with them is irreperably damaged. i have no place in my heart right now (as im reeling from the pain) to speak with them. i wanted to share my story and was curious if anyone feels i am being ""too hard"" on my parents as they didn't know better (and he was likely abused in a similar way)

my family is stressed and anxious that ive cut off communication with them, and i now have people in my life (who i have tried to open up to) saying ""i shouldnt lose my family"" and i should try to mend my relationship with them.

i am so depressed, anxious, and have exhibited suicidal tendencies that i feel therapy and distance from my family is the best way to heal... wanted to solicit feedback from this group. thank you"|1
"I figured I'd ask the people who actually deal with depression instead of taking Google's advice. What makes you feel safe/comforted/heard when talking to someone? Are there ways I can show that I'm listening?

Maybe this is a stupid question, but I figured I'd try anyway.

Edit: Myself and my friend-in-question live in different countries (big oof there, I know)"|1
"For as long as I can remember, I’ve loved making art. Drawing, painting, coloring, building, you name it. However, over the past two years or so (and especially once the quarantine started) I just feel empty whenever I try doing anything artistic. I recently tried to start a project where I drew a self portrait every day until a notebook was filled up, and I made it maybe 2 weeks before I couldn’t do it anymore. 

I don’t feel any sort of happiness when making art, I don’t feel any sort of gratification when finishing a piece (on the rare chance that I actually do finish something nowadays), and even when people compliment my work, I just meekly thank them and move on.

I wanted to be an artist when I was younger, something like a propmaker, prosthetics artist, or digital effects artist, but how can I pursue something like than when I can’t even finish one piece?"|1
"I see people on internet who are ""proud to be trans"" or something. I mean, I don't blame anyone for being proud of being themselves but you can't expect everyone to be proud of themselves. I mean, as someone who is living Middle East, I don't even have to chance to present as myself. I don't have the privilege to go under surgeries that I want and I am tired of trying to find an angle which I don't look like a boy. I am so tired."|1
It's just upsetting that he's never involved me in activities and I'm 28 now and the clock can't be wound back. It's just very upsetting to see.|1
No matter how long I seem to be able to ignore it, it always comes back. I've had no issue for 2 months, just taking it one day at a time. But recently I just thought about my future, and it comes rushing back at me and I break down.|1
"So you know how in your family, your parent is a doctor or whatever, and you uncle is a lawyer, and your aunt is a nurse, and they all have great jobs with great pay. And you go to Disneyland every other summer, and you're close with your cousins?

And then you have cousins who's parents work at not so great jobs with decent pay, and they've never gone to a major theme park or attraction because they can never save up enough money to go, and they live in another state and you see them every summer at your grandparents house.

that's me, I'm your cousin that gets kind of clingy because they have little to no friends and every time they make a new one the friendship lasts at most 2 years, and they eventually just leave and go to the guestroom in your house and never leave. You don't know them very well, and once your both grown you'll likely never see eachother again? Yep, that me."|1
"Hello all.  This is my first post so please be gentle.  I have been agonising about making this post because of the nature of the forum so I'm hoping it won't cause anyone to much distress.

What do you think of the idea that depressed people are not infact depressed and simply have a more accurate view of life?"|1
"Too tired right now to describe why I feel that way or talk about my life story.

But I will say that my depression about this has been bad to where I’ve been posting multiple threads across multiple subreddits over the past couple of days, from how women hate male virgins by my age and how you should lie, to how much it sucks indidnt experience romance and sex in my teens and early 20s and how nothing will be good as that, to how men should never be vulnerable in front of women since they find weakness disgusting, to why I have reservations about seeing a sex worker since they don’t love you, to about how some guys are just gonna be alone for their whole lives. People gave me advice but I dismissed it all because I feel like it’s nothing but platitudes and I feel I’m a lost cause. The stuff you see all the time, like therapy or hitting the gym. Some people called me names like loser and insulted me. Some told me I should kill myself. Others called me an emotional vampire who doesn’t wanna help himself, and instead just bitch. Some said I was nothing but entertainment to them. But I don’t feel like I can help myself. I feel this is my fate. I feel like it’s impossible, or I’m too scared and overwhelmed to even try. 

Maybe I am an attention whore. But sometimes I just want a shoulder to cry on and a hug more than anything. Or just a friend who’ll give me a chance as long as I don’t push them away out of fear.

Or a woman who doesn’t exist…"|1
Just feels no matter how much I try to get better,    I'm stuck in the same shitty rut. It's like I'm in a patch of quick sand, and no matter how much I put effort I'm still sinking. My brain is my worst enemy, making me believe that everything i touch is garbage. I hate my house, relationship, job, roommates; literally everything that I've created and continue to live. I see no way out, feel like my life is over; and I'm only 25...|1
" Like most people on this sub, I've being struggling with myself for a long while. I don't have anyone to share my feelings with in my personal life, so I created an account a year ago and started following the sub. In the beginning I was a passive member, but in time I became very active, talking to people, sharing my experience and trying to help others.

 And by doing so I've being able to help myself and many others, helping other people and sharing experiences has being very helpful. 

So  I'd like to say thank you to all of you, for being my friends."|1
That's really it I guess. I'm just not allowed to cry not now not ever I can't experience any emotion except happy or I get screamed and yelled at and told to shut the fuck up and I just really wanted to vent on here because it's the only way I can express my emotions anymore and I don't want to end up hurting myself because I didn't get my feelings out.|1
Everyone just says it’ll get better but it’s been over a decade and it’s just been getting worse...i get treated like crap at my job..any relationships I get in I’m just used for either sex and money then left for dead. I have no friends or anybody to talk to...my family all just think I’m crazy and don’t say anything to me..what’s the point in trying anymore..|1
"Hi all, first time poster. Found this while I’m sitting on my couch alone this rainy Friday night. I thought I’d post here for an outlet of my feelings. 

I’m 20 tomorrow. I remember crying to my fiancé-then-boyfriend when I turned 19. “I don’t think I can make it another year” was the only sentence that stuck in my head from that day. Since last year, I got therapy again (and actually told the truth, which is harder than I thought it was going to be), became an (almost) full time adult, and got put on an anti-depressant (Wellbutrin). I recently got an apartment in my college town (that I’m paying for myself), and my fiancé has left for a month for a job thousands of miles away. 

I knew that living by myself meant I had to spend a lot of time with myself, and be alone most of the day. I guess I didn’t realize how lonely it really is. I sit on my couch and watch people all day cross the intersection my window looks out onto and get high. I sit at night and listen to the bar downstairs, the live music and all the people. It just makes me lonelier. My boyfriend and I were attached at the hip from March 2020 until about a week ago. That’s also why I feel even more lonelier. I try to get out on walks, but my depression keeps me glued to my couch even if it’s a beautiful day out. I currently am out of school, and my job doesn’t start for another 2 weeks. All I can think of again this birthday is “I don’t know if I’m gonna make it another year.” I know I will, but I have issues believing in myself. 

People who live alone, what do you do to fight the loneliness/boredom/couch potato state of mind that comes with depression? I have access to a car so I love to drive when I can. With gas prices, though, and my current financial struggle, I can’t afford to drive for miles. I love to paint, but it’s just not in the checkbook. Any advice is appreciated, and thank you in advance."|1
I hate being depressed and just stuck in my room and crying for no reason ….. i want out … i can physically feel myself getting in that black hole again … i dont want meds i just want to operate normally …. How??|1
I am having a really hard time right now and have no one in my life to talk to. Can't stop crying, so a call service wouldn't be a good idea for me. I really need someone right now. If anyone knows any free text help services I would really appreciate it.|1
hey i’m a 20yo physics major. i suffer from schizophrenia and depression and i’m having a bad day. just looking for someone to talk to so i can distract myself|1
I’m just waiting for him to tell me I have no chance, or that he doesn’t love me, he hates me. Any of it. I’m waiting for the day that comes and I will finally kill myself. Until then I’ll just keep trying to get my best friend back.|1
I feel like the life I’m living in doesn’t belong to me, I care about things I shouldn’t, and just hurt myself for it. I’m too scared to ask for help, as I’ve already been forgotten by psychiatrists and doctors before. I don’t want to be so dependent on anti depressants but perhaps my happiness might need to rely on it forever.|1
"I don’t like the way life feels.

I’m really losing hope that there is something or someone out there that can help me. A little backstory:

I am 21, and have been depressed since I was a young teen. I’ve been chronically ill with multiple illnesses my entire life. Not one day has gone by where I haven’t felt sick in some way. I am getting treated for my illnesses (which took years of fighting in some instances), but this still takes a toll on me on top of regular life issues. 

I have always felt different, as I was adopted by parents of a different culture than my own, as well them raising me in an alternative lifestyle (vegetarian, home schooled, etc). My thoughts and behaviors on things are different than most people’s and I suppose I could be considered a social loser. I never had any friends who stayed around me, and have never had any relationships work out either. Even coworkers at jobs (which I never do good at either because I’m ill or socially stupid) never liked me much. 

I was ahead in college, and even was recognized for my high GPA. But I dropped out due to all of the pressure causing me so much anxiety that I couldn’t breathe. Now I’m behind for my age group and feel like a failure. I plan to return, but because of covid, I don’t have shit for money, and my health is preventing me from getting a job that would pay enough (for the time-being, I do Instacart deliveries). 

I feel like everyone around me is successful somehow, either with money, or fitness, or happiness, or socially. But I’m horrible at these things. I’m skinny, but I fear getting fat because sometimes I just don’t have the energy to move a lot. 

In a nutshell, I don’t like the downs, or even the ups of life. I just don’t like the way life feels in general. I try to enjoy myself, but it doesn’t work. I’ve gone to SEVERAL therapists, none of which could help me. I’ve tried mindfulness, which has made me spiritual, but beyond that, doesn’t make me like life. Writing a journal doesn’t do anything. Medication makes me feel worse. I don’t have friends to talk to, just my mom, but she can’t make me like life. I have pets, but they can’t do anything for me. I’ve tried Googling answers and it just says go to therapy which doesn’t help me any. 

Is there anything else? ANYTHING? I want the agony to stop."|1
"I feel like it would be so helpful if I had friends who accepted me when I’m depressed. I know that’s a lot to ask for, and I’m not expecting people to cure me. I just feel like my life would be easier if people were more understanding and didn’t blame me for being depressed.

Sometimes I fantasize about someone just sitting on the floor with me when I’m at my worst. I feel like that would be so therapeutic. It’s strange how such a simple thing feels so out of reach. It feels like nobody really knows how to be there for other people in that way. It’s a shame"|1
"From ages 3-17 my relationship with my mum was really bad, she had undiagnosed bipolar and treated me pretty badly (mild CPTSD from it). Now she’s on medication and is so much better, we don’t argue, we have long, nice conversations and she does nice things for me. This is all great but it’s also making me feel more depressed than when she was treating me like crap because atleast i could just go out and see friends. Now i’m getting the relationship with my mum that i’ve always wanted JUST as i’ve started a full time job and i’ve finished exams so i’m out seeing friends a lot. I feel so guilty because i’ve missed out all my life on this relationship and i’m only getting it just as i’m moving to adulthood and have less time. i was so excited to get this job but i can’t help but feel sad. obviously i’ll still see her, but for some reason whenever i’m not at home i feel like i’m missing out on time i could’ve spent with my mum making up for all those years lost. 
we just had a chat after my shift today and i’m here crying because she’s trying to actually make up for stuff and i’ve just been at work - she wants me to work and she’s rlly proud of me but i still feel like crap"|1
"Hi all,

First I am happy to find a subreddit where people will understand what I am talking about. The support I have seen here is amazing. And apologies for my rambling and any errors I might make. Just looking for a little direction on how to go on from here.

I have struggled on and off with depression and anxiety for years and it has always come and gone. I lead a quite stressful life in the moment (had some relationship issues, stressful career, going back to uni, and occasional loneliness as an expat) so really not surprised about the return of my depression.

But this time I am finding it hard to be interested in or committed to anything. Even things I loved and things I know I have to do. I usually love learning and reading and doing my hobbies but now I really would rather just zone out. I was a very good student and loved learning languages and now I am disappointed in myself to not be doing so well in school or even have the interest to do well.

I know in order to calm my anxiety and to get on the right track I should try to restart some hobbies but I am just struggling a lot. This time around my depression has awakened some awful insecurities and I want to go back to occupying my brain with activities and hobbies to give my brain something else to chew on. I am trying to make a new schedule for myself and wake up earlier and be active in the morning with some success, but even after this I am back to being empty brained. It's just so hard to make the effort.

Has anyone had a similar experience? What steps did you take to get out of it? I would really appreciate any advice."|1
"Hello!

I recently switched from Zoloft/sertraline to mirtazapine- the Zoloft was making me have bad suicidal and intrusive thoughts, and made me an asexual blob. I would be curious to know what mirtazapine is like for you. The morning grogginess is real."|1
"I (open-minded 31F, but ansolutely not feminine and a Disnerd) regularly wish I had some company on my PS4. I'm too scared to ask the same few people over and over again, in fear I'll be annoying if it's too often. I just want to enjoy some time together with a like-minded person, playing something coop. Perhaps get a little distracted from my/our thoughts as well. I'm not particularly good (although, I like collecting platinum trophies for some weird reason) and I'm shy, so voice chat is out of question at first, but who knows.. later on? I promise I'll behave :( I just want.. some company..? Perhaps some sweet soul wishes for the same.. Ah well, what a mess I am 
(Timezone = CEST)

Good night"|1
I felt I was finally getting somewhere with getting treatment, but the whole world going on lockdown kind of stopped that in its tracks. I frankly just don't know if I can make it till it opens back up. I can't live by going through endless coping mechanisms to make it through a day. Also when you go years without treatment and the doctors ask, when you beg for help, ' what made your depression worse?'  It's like do you actually get what this is at all. That's like asking someone at the end of a marathon 'why are you so sweaty and out of breath?'|1
Because I feel like this a heck of a lot and i try and act like it doesnt get to me but i'd be lying if i said it doesnt feel painful|1
"i just feel like everything is my fault like i’m a burden i’m sorry i’m really sorry i don’t want to make your life any worse they would probably be better off if i was dead because i mess everything up i hurt her feelings she hurt mine i’m a jealous piece of shit. selfish. 
i hate myself.
you know one of my coworkers invited me to a little cook out their doing but i think they just invited me to be nice you don’t want me there i get so anxious thinking about it i just don’t feel comfortable in big crowds i can’t i just can’t. i can’t order anything i can’t go in the gas station. i can’t talk idk why i can talk just fine but when we take the masks off omg i’m so scared i can’t i work there for 10 months with a mask  i like it because they can’t see me. i can’t work there i can’t. i want to kill myself.    i’m sorry i’m sorry you met me i’m sorry i’m so sorry"|1
"Depression, who are you? 
The doctor says we’ve met. 
I didn’t think I knew you, but come to think of it...
I knew you as a child as I grew through the years. 
I knew you as a young adult as I fought against my fears. 
We intertwined and became a pair, your gloom and my shine. 
I’ve slowly been dimming through the years; oh where does it go, the time? 
I don’t want to take the easy way out, I’ve tried and failed. 
Life has more to offer, it just has yet to be unveiled."|1
"This morning I woke up after having another dream about my ex, who dumped me 5 years ago. And in my dream she rejected me again, and convinced everyone else to reject me as well. Had another nervous breakdown and called a phone help line, then went to the discord and tried to find help there as well. Then read a couple chapters out of How To Win Friends looking for some sort of pick-up. Then I gathered all my energy and made a decent breakfast, hoping that good food would help. 

Finally feeling somewhat ok, I set up my phone to record a video submission for a musical gig. I really picked up my guitar and singing skills over quarantine this last year, and I'm excited to show them off and hopefully use them to get better gigs. After finally getting a take that I was happy with I logged in to my email and clicked the link to upload it to the dropbox. 

And that's when I noticed that I was an hour late and the option to upload new submissions was closed. I've been working on this all week, was really excited about this chance to show off my new skills, and now I feel even more worthless. And this isn't the first time my depression has grabbed all my attention and kept me from opportunities that would actually raise my confidence and self esteem. It's a horribly vicious cycle that I can't seem to break out of."|1
I hate it. I just want to feel sane and safe in my own mind again.|1
"I really don't know after last week's Friday I have again a hard time, normally my life is shit and that is okay I'm lonely depressed and burd out of all energy just passing through the days bearly... But I don't know I had 2 atamps in my past and r know I think it is time again... I looks for poisen this time, I think it makes thinks easier.. Just get drunk and here we go... I know I should call a hospital and get help before I go and start this plan but why should I? I'm 80%of my life alone, I was let down by doctors that I was seeking for help.. In the end it is always me alone pushing and fighting in a war that I can't win... It is so far that this is not even emotionall for me I don't cry I don't feel bad it is just a idear or move like going to Markt and get some bread it is normal not abstract. no safeguard like emotions a normally. Over the last years it only gets worse and worse and I struggle for 15 years with it... The last 2-3 years I seekt help with no sign of change.


So why do I post this here? Do I wanne here it is going better in the future? Or do I wanne hear some people being sad about it? No absolut not.. I have a hard time to show how bad my state is and how down I m, this is just to get thinks out of me...  I know nobody cares really and that is fine I make my peace with that but I want a outlet even it is just for me... Maybe I should riede more often... If I can hang in this dumbserfire of my life"|1
"Complex MDD with cPTSD, OCD, GAD diagnosed. Occasional ED, SH. 
Real alphabet soup winner over here. 

I was unstable as an early teenager while in abusive home life. As an adult I’ve been okay, well managed everything with Buddhist practice, antidepressants and therapy.... until 18 months ago. 

Had a PPD break, and on-going sleep deprivation + cPTSD in home life has me back into self harm. 
I’m such a failure. I’m scared to tell my psychiatrist how bad it is.

I just want to remind everyone here, we deserve better. We all suffer with depression and the battles that come with the mental illness. But because we struggle and hate ourselves often we tend to fear losing those we love and we let them hurt us. I recently moved on from my ex finally and honestly I’m finally realizing I deserved better. Depression harms every aspect of our lives, so please keep your eye out and remember we deserve more. You deserve more.|1
I really feel life is pointless. One day we die and all our efforts are for nothing. It’s hard to keep going sometimes. I’m down the shore for Memorial Day and I’m so lonely it’s insane. I don’t have any friends, and all my actual “friends” use me for their own benefit. No one cares for me. I’m pretty unattractive and struggle socially and kind find friends. I go on social media and see how everyone is having a great time but me. I just don’t know if I could keep going anymore. Life is so pointless to me, especially since I really have nobody.|1
A few moments ago I just had a family call me weird. I was minding my own business waiting for the bus to come, waking around the area trying to avoid stepping on any Cicadas when a nearby family saw what I was doing and said it was weird. They also gave the implication that I had awful intentions as they mentioned that there were kids around. I think one of the kids said that they were either scared or not scared of me. Moments like this remind me why I don’t like being around other people. What they did to me was incredibly rude and made me really angry. How dare they treat me like a psychopath because of something simple like this.|1
"I work in customer service, but luckily my job can be done entirely over email. Every time I have a day off, there's at least one client who just needs to bully me and I'm just so sick of my days off being ruined by some asshole harassing me until they get what they want. 

I know that I could ignore my email and ignore voicemails I get, but when I get several calls in a row I assume I should listen to the voicemail to make sure I didn't screw anything up. No, it's just one idiot who waited until the last minute to get things moving forward.

Oh, to top things off I have a pretty bad cold and don't feel great. Good thing I'm crying to dehydrate myself! I hate this life, and I hate people."|1

"hello. 20F here and tbh i dont rlly know why im typing this. i just needed to let this be out because people dont understand why it matters much to me. 

recently applied for university and i got rejected. i chose a major which has like a minimum admission gpa of 3.2 (out of 4.0). i graduated recently with a decent gpa, that most of my friends and teacher said that i should be able to enter without any problems. i submitted an appeal but the outcome has yet released.

the people around me reacted with the typical - ‘how could you not get in???’’perhaps its your medical conditions’ (i have scoliosis and social anxiety yikes). during the application, the university stated that the declaration of my medical conditions will not have any effect on my application, but my parents didnt believe that.

ok sorry im rambling and going off topic. so, it hurts. while my friends despise studying, it was that ONE thing. the ONE thing that i believed whole heartedly could excel on. the one thing that i was sincerely proud of. that i actually worked and studied hard which resulted in excellent academic performance. the one thing that made me feel useful. that i could actually do something. that i can make people happy and be proud of me too. being an awkward and introverted being, ive always been keen to learn because its the only way i could distract myself from my own thoughts. i was really really proud of myself of being able to excel academically and achieve the grades i wanted.

then came the rejection letter and everything crumbles downs. my brain keeps telling me - you are not enough, never will be. i have been struggling in 2020 and after completing my final semester, i felt like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulder. for that with my grades that i was so proud of, i will be able to pursue further studies. in the early weeks of waiting for the application result, i told myself that it doesnt matter if i cant get in because theres always an alternative which is to work first.  

it has been about 5 days since that rejection letter. it still hurts today. it feels like i couldnt even do a single thing right. i no longer have the thing that i was so proud of. no longer believe that i could excel. that no matter how much effort i put in, it will never be enough."|1
When i wake up i feel depressed i cry but force myself to wake up open my windows eat something and brush my teeth 😣 i just feel so scared that i can feel it in my stomach but its crazy because when night comes I don’t feel as depressed as i am during the day its weird and it’s scaring me but i guess its normal with someone with depression i just hope I don’t stay this way forever its a horrible feeling 😣😓💔|1
I've been on a limbo. Have tried committing once, and the desire is pretty much there still. But I've asked for help, I have friends and my family is heavily supportive. I'm taking some meds, have been to therapy. I have enormous luck. Yet I don't see anything coming good from the future, it's like I'm living inside a loop. This is a bit pseud, I guess, but I do believe time destroys everything. In the end, I think I'll die in the way I was meant to. I feel very sorry for everybody that has been helping me for being like this.|1
"I just want to be held and to be loved, there's no more I can ask than that.

My own parents never wanted me, so to me their hugs are empty...

no.. I need a stranger to hold me tightly and whisper to me.. everything is gonna be okay.

Why is this too much to ask?"|1
My dog just died. I don't know what to do. He has been a lifelong friend of mine and now he is gone. I don't know who I should talk to this about. Everyone has been telling me to 'Tough it up' or 'It's just a dog' And I've tried. I really have. But I just can't stop thinking about him. I'm sorry if I'm being annoying, but I need help.|1
Ended up being referred for therapy and given a prescription for sertraline, guess we’ll see how it goes.|1
I can’t imagine what it’s like to have a passion or to do something you actually enjoy doing. I’m supposed to start community college next semester and I couldn’t be less excited about it. All my friends are looking forward to going to college and they’re all moving away at least 3 hours away because that’s where their colleges are. I have to be alone. I don’t have anything to look forward to. I’m not going to discover my passion in a classroom. If I have to get a degree for a job I hate just to live, I might as well just die. This life clearly just isn’t for me if that’s all there is. It’s alarming how often I think of suicide now|1
Like really fucking crave it...|1
I go to therapy every day still want to die can’t push my self to try dating again completely don’t care about anyone around me yet want friends and affection I panic sold most of my etherum money isn’t a problem but will never make me happy especially cause it’s not substantial I still think about my ex where I was the toxic one and was also called an incel. I had no idea what this was but she hit the nail in the coffin. I want to love so bad but am disturbed I think for life. I want to die but how do I know I won’t suffer in after life or if there is one. I look forward to doing coke and watching porn the rest of my life thjnk that’s all what makes me happy. And farting.|1
It's been 26 years I've been in this world, always gave my best to make all my loved ones feel their best, but yet, I always feel the worse. I never have a day of peace in my mind and I always feel everyone I love is leaving. My dreams aren't my hideout anymore either as they became torture. I don't want to be here anymore.|1
I've been dealing with depression ptsd and bipolar disorder for over 10 years now, I've never had a solid support system. When I was younger I was angry and stubborn so never established a relationship with a solid therapist that could grow with me, a mistake I try not to beat myself up for. I've been on a waitlist for over a year now for some type of therapy. Anyways, I have my partner of 3 years as the only form of support lately. I have a psychiatrist and a group therapy, but they're not for distress or one on one advice at all. I feel more alone than I ever have before.  I don't have any friends or anything and am not sure how to exactly. I don't like bothering my family or partner with my mental health issues because I don't  want to stress them out or put any extra weight on them. How do I healthily communicate my feelings to them and also establish a stronger support system.|1
"I have been having panic attacks / depresssion / suicidal thoughts for the past few weeks and have attempted to reach out to multiple mental health professionals for the past week for a consultation. No replies, no calls, no nothing. I am legitimately about to end my life and even the ""proper"" avenues of getting help are failing. I don't want to use an app, I don't want to call a hotline, I want to sit in front of a second human being and talk through my issues but it only takes fifteen minutes to clear a background check for a gun to end my life. I'm so sad and frustrated and I don't know how much longer I can keep this going."|1
"Hello everyone. I am currently working in a fast-food chain. I am 26 years old and due to bad decisions, I have to work in fast food until I complete my degree. I am hoping to get into a better job related to my degree however this has to do for now as it pays the bills.

I absolutely hate this job. I hate the rude and entitled customers. I hate the long working hours from 10am in the morning till 10pm at night. I hate it when after I long day, i'm ready to close and go home, a bunch of customer walk in the minute i'm about to close and order a large meal, making me late by 30min (unpaid) and having to get home at 1am. I can't take it. It is causing me severe depression.

I'm not addicted and I only drink once every month or so. When I do drink, I feel much more relaxed and easy-going. I am considering after my lunch break, to take a few shots to relax my mood. I will disguise it in a sprite bottle so no one knows and I will make sure to control myself so that I just get a light buzz and it won't affect my work performance. I was wondering if any of you drink while on the job to deal with the stress and depression?

I do enjoy drinking and I am starting to think maybe I won't start the dread work if I know that I can be relaxed by taking a few shots...what do you guys think?"|1
"I wish I was a bubbly, extrovert who is seemingly always in a good mood and thinking positively. I find however on days when I'm struggling with my mood, that these people make me feel like shit. Guilty as well. And then I compare myself to them and blame myself for not being as ""together"" as they are. Bubbly people can make me feel like an alien....I'm putting so much effort into getting through the day and they're actually ENJOYING their day?? Baffling. Anyone relate? I think this is why my best friend is also quite deadpan and prone to depression. It should be a criminal offence to be bubbly around a depressed person lol. On the spot fine"|1
"I can’t do anything right, not even kill myself.

I have nothing left to lose.
I so desperately want to kill myself, but I have no real means of doing so efficiently. Lexapro apparently won’t kill me. 

I’m tired of remembering my ex girlfriend.  I’ve dreamt about her so much and all steps I’ve taken to move on just seem fucking pointless because I’m so haunted by the experience. 

My asshole father was never around. Didn’t bother calling or wishing me well a few years ago following another failed suicide attempt. 
Wasn’t there for me when I was little being molested by my uncle. One of the only people I ever looked up to at the time. 

Mom doesn’t care. Reiterated my own feelings toward the abuse as being my fault. Yelled and grew frustrated with me for constantly asking for years if she could take me to get tested for STDs.  Told me the other day that my last attempt was so I could get my ex’s attention. 


I’m out of shape, ugly inside and out, and I have no redeeming qualities.
No job. Have no money. No friends.
Don’t ever want to love again because I don’t have feelings anymore. 
I just wanted to be happy.  I want a gun to stop my crying.  I want to stop thinking and feeling."|1
I had depression a few years ago. It was so bad that suicidal thoughts were a norm at the time. But around a year later after I noticed I was depressed it just disappeared. I don't know what I did but I remember at the time I used to walk alot like an hour a day. I was also a very religious person and I know that was what gave me the strength to deal with it|1
In the red -$200 and waiting on two background checks for jobs. 1 over a month, the other about a week. How unlucky you gotta be to be in this situation.|1
" I'm 30 years old. I have a GF of 7 years. And a 1 year old daughter. My daughter is hard work. She won't come to me. Just winges all day for her Mom. I play with her, cuddle her, read to her and I get the odd feedback but it's mostly met with crying and pushing away. 

We currently live in my parents due to saving for a house, my daughter sleeps in our bed. So me and my GF barely touch each other. No kissing, cuddling definitely no sex. I work from home due to the pandemic so I basically live in my bedroom. My GF knows about my depression but doesn't know on the scale of it. She tells me not to let it get to me but it does.

Due to my loneliness and sadness I found a site on Reddit called Bi Curious. I've never had any attraction to Guys but all of a sudden I've found myself on there and letting them flirt with me and I'll be honest I've jacked off over Kik with a few off them as well and Roleplayed. I don't even know why I've done this apart from the taboo and just a need to feel wanted by absolutely anyone. I keep being pushed away and I can't even cry. I tried last week and I had a little sob and was back downstairs trying to put on a brave face. 

On paper I have everything. Lots of friends, a good family, a GF who despite everything I know loves me. And I just feel dead inside. I feel empty. I get zero pleasure from life and I cannot wait to go to bed at night so I can dream. 

I cannot talk to my GF as she will just brush it off. I certainly cannot tell her about the bi curious thing she will not understand plus I've betrayed her really even if it is fantasy. 

I'm 30 years old. Still in my Mom's with my GF and daughter. I don't drive, I have a shitty job which pays next to nothing, I've done absolutely nothing with my life. 

I just feel like walking to a bridge and jumping off just as a passing car comes. Done. Over. Freedom.

Thank you for reading if you got this far."|1
"I'm hitting new levels of low, higher levels of extreme self-hatred, and new ideas of checking out. I need help, but I cant afford it, and I dont have access or time to see one frequently. I dont see any way to see one until after a year. 

Can anyone suggest ways to survive until then?"|1
"I have done nothing of value in the past 5 years. Nothing I have done has led to anything, nor have I genuinely enjoyed a single day that I've been alive in the past 10 years.

I think about my age often and think about how I have lost the most valuable years of my life to nothing. I am not like others my age; I don't have friends nor do I have a normal life. I work at home at a dumb job and do nothing but talk to people on the phone all day. Given the opportunities I had and wasted, it is pathetic that this is where I am.

I am disappointed with my life and it doesn't seem like it can change. I don't like myself because I lack intellect, maturity, common sense and awareness. I'm a loser, anxious and cowardly. I have done many things I am not proud of and very few that I can call achievements. I have accomplished virtually nothing and my existence has no purpose.

More often than not in the past 5 years, I've wished I weren't around."|1
I’m starting to feel more worthless each and every day I’m a 22 year old male living with his mother trying to figure out my purpose in today’s society I’m too dumb to attend college and I don’t necessarily have a trade nor skill to fall back on ever since I graduated high school all I’ve been doing is working for lousy retail companies and ride sharing platforms that pay slave wages and I honestly want better for myself it’s frustrating watching all my fellow class men go on to have successful career and live there best lives while I’m stuck at home living in a poverty with a chaotic and dysfunctional family it’s been this way for 5+ years and it’s becoming a repeated cycle it’s weighing down on my mental state and as the days go by I start to feel more and more cursed because I’m a good person who just wants too feel like he belongs in this world most days if I’m not trying to figure how I should proceed with my life I’m then sulking and sleeping my life away everything sucks and most days I wish that someone would kill me and save me from a long and miserable/meaningless life|1
I've never posted on reddit before, but today I feel like  any advice I could get would be a huge help. My friend is dealing with a severe depression. He's barely sleeping and I'm really worried. He usually sleeps 2-3 hours, sometimes 5 on a good day. He tried everything and nothing seems to work for him to sleep. It seems like he's giving up on trying to sleep and just accepted the idea of being constantly tired. Not even the sleeping pills help. So the question would be, if anyone's got some advice that's actually worked, could you please share it on here. Sending a huge thank you for you peeps!|1
I  have no motivation to do anything .. Every day I wake up in the morning and write a list of things that I want to accomplish today .. I eat my breakfast and then lie in bed all day and all i do is internet and overthinking .. The only thing that I spend my energy on is overthinking..i can't stop it.  I did not even clean and tidy my room for two weeks ... it's  painful and difficult to arrange the place.  Does anyone have any advice that can help me get things done ?|1
"I’ve been going through a really difficult time lately. I feel stuck, unmotivated, and overwhelmed. I used to try and reach out, but I learned I’m more of an emotional vampire than anything - so now I don’t want to talk to friends about what I’m going through. We all struggle and have our own issues to deal with and I no longer want to be that overly emotional drain on people - I recognize it’s not fair, but how do you reach out and talk about things without doing this? I feel like I’m victimizing myself or maybe that I find comfort in being distressed...

I feel like I can’t have a normal conversation without my emotional distress slipping out. It’s so hard to connect with people right now. 

I lost my job to COVID, moved back in with my parents, and have no savings. I feel like there’s this giant mountain in front of me that I need to overcome before I’m even in a spot to be able to help myself and overcome the actual mountain that’s preventing me from living a fulfilling life. 

I feel like I’ve built a much better foundation for my future these last five years. I went from drinking every day and waking up in my own vomit to being a year away from graduating with a masters in computer science. I never thought I’d have a future so I never really planned for it. But now that I’m actually going to graduate...I feel like I don’t know how to navigate the next step into building a career. 

With no current job, no savings, and no insurance I’m not sure how to go about finding counselors/therapists to talk to. I tell myself to be stronger for a little longer and once things open up again I’ll have more opportunities - I’m just tired of feeling like I’m always falling behind. I don’t know who to talk to or how to help myself."|1
"You could say its not important, well: I got a dream. I wanted to get rock and grunge famous again.

I was thinking of guitar all day: thats how asperger works in my brain. Guitar was there when something bad happens. You strum as hard as you can and feel better. I tried to commit suicide.

I went to my room and started to cry. Connected guitar and put on distort, And strummed hard. I broke 3 strings

Thats something i wont ever do again but, ¿How deep can i get in the exploration of luck, life moments, dark moments in general? Well, im going so deep that light vanished years ago, and trust me i dont see kind creatures here. A sadic angler who just killed a fish that was curious, a war between species and every kind of plastic. My brain WAS a safe place. I want my life back, please"|1
I’m 19 and I honestly don’t know if I’m truly depressed or just sensitive to shit, but I can’t help but feel like a failure when I can’t get a job and when I finally do get a job and I can’t even do it right. For example getting a job that requires me to set up meetings with people to talk about products but people don’t even want to set up a meeting, even the people I thought I was close to wouldn’t want to meet let alone let me speak to them about the appointment. I honestly don’t know how to move forward and there are some days where I feel I’m better off dead rather than being a burden and waking up hopeful for something to change. I don’t even know how to talk about it with my family I feel like my parents would think I’m being a wimp and exaggerating it and idek how to bring it up to my siblings. I just don’t know how to moe forward in life when I keep failing at everything I do|1

"Im a massive loser who has huge traumas from his childhood and never had any real frnds, am an only child, and very emotionally distant parents. I have so much baggage and feelings bottled up and not once, not once in my life have i ever been able to share or talk it out with anyone. Always put on a mask of smiling or just going and sitting in my own corner. 
I get teary eyed whenever I see or hear that someone else shared their pain on phone with a loved one or a frnd, because I know I'm always in this battle alone, i'll never have anyone give a shit about me. 
My head starts hurting the first thing in the morning because there's just so much going on in it. Im unemployed now and that just adds up to it. Just going through the daily motions itself is a huge burden and I'm srsly done with everything now, I'm at proper rock bottom. I don't deserve shit.

To everyone who has a frnd or someone close with whom u can cry or pour ur heart out, please always always realise how lucky u are to have them and what a precious person they are to truly listen to u. U are truly blessed. Stay happy :-)"|1
"Been suffering from depression for almost 5 years  (I'm in 1st year of college right now) and every year goes by it just gets worse, I always get tired just end up sleeping, if I have some school works I just end up procrastinating or sometimes don't do it. This is badly affecting my relationship with my MU(soon to be GF). I already talked to my love once and my friends about it, but for me, it just doesn't help much, I'm still like this... 

 Is there anything I can do rather than just believe? Because I'm slowly losing my hope and there's not a single goddamn day where I don't think about killing myself. To be honest I really just wanna grow up happy/just be a normal fucking person without suffering from this illness.

For those who read this, thank you and I love you..."|1

"I got depression in seventh grade due to bullying by teachers and kids due to my social anxiety and struggle to keep up at school. I'd been called fat, poor, a moron, an idiot, incompetent, stupid, loser, etc all before the age of 13. At the age of 13, the depression got overwhelmingly worse when my best friend decided I wasn't interesting anymore. One day the school decided to tell my parents I wasn't fit to study there because of how depressed I am. I only agreed to change schools because I made my parents promise they would get me a therapist. You guessed it, they never got me one and I went from the best school in the city to one of the most disgusting ones. Life only got worse and my mom found out about my self-harm and somehow made it about herself. She kept telling me she'd failed as a parent and that she should kill herself too. She went on to threaten me with harming herself when I lagged behind in class. She said the words ""the face you're making right now is the face girls make when they're r\*ped. The abuse continued in various ways and this year, she dug a knife into her wrist in front of me because I was too insecure about my body to jog in front of other people. She constantly thinks I'm lying about everything and just when I thought she was letting me live, she dropped the bomb of 'I've been tracking your internet history and know exactly when you're lying about studying. The only hope I have at a college I can afford is just a few miles from my city which means she'll find a way to monitor me. I can't afford school in another country. I'm trapped and lost. This is not even everything she has done to me. I just wish to be heard. Anyone who reached this far, thank you for listening. I'm now more suicidal than I've been in a while and I don't want to share it with a friend. I feel like a burden"|1
"I'm a PhD student finishing off, I applied for 3 dream positions and got I got 3 job offers - 2 in Europe, one in the US. I should be happy.

Today I took a sick day off work to stay in bed. I just managed to get up to cook food after not eating for a entire day."|1
The past few days have been weird feeling. I Im not depressed but i do feel sad but almost like a mild sadness that never stops. My depression episodes never feel this empty. I lost my appetite and haven’t had the mood to eat. I feel like my partner stopped loving me. It’s only a matter of time before he realizes it and ends it. Everything that Made me feel nice, just feels off and forced. I feel like overnight everything went grey.|1
"Hi there, I have been showing symptoms of depression for 5 years now, and in the last 2 years it started heavily affecting my studying. I just either can't understand the subject, lose focus or am way too unmotivated to even start doing something. I have some important exams coming in the near future, and I have to read a lot of stuff for literature, yet I seem to be unable to do shit. 
Any tips for studying in this situation?"|1
"To be honest, I feel but I don't know how to explain my feelings. I've thought about offing myself more times than I can count on my hands in the last 24 hours. I've thought about hurting myself (again) and all this didn't even have a trigger. I feel like I'm holding on to do much but I don't know how to let it go. I've been crying, screaming for years but I can never truly let it all out and it just feels like it builds up and I cry for a few days and then I'm fine and then it strikes again. It's always there and I don't know how to get rid of it. I feel like I'm annoying or self-absorbed, selfish and maybe even narcissistic like I make everything about me like maybe I use this condition as an excuse for being an asshole for acting like everything is about me. I'm sensitive to every little thing that happens around me and I end up feeling like it's about me like the small changes in the moods of the people around me are my fault like maybe I did something wrong. Yesterday I was listening to the soundtrack of Dear Evan Hansen and I started sobbing and I really felt like offing myself. Today evening, my mom was in a bad mood. I spent the whole day with her and she was fine but on our way home her mood changed and I thought that maybe it was because of me but I honestly wasn't in the mood to deal with that (my mistake) because she always does things like this. She's always talking about how we should communicate but she never does when it counts. She just does the "" I'm not happy with you right now but you'll have to figure out why for yourself"" thing and I'm always the one who has to initiate discussions about our issues. So I'm listening to the Dear Evan Hansen soundtrack again because it makes me feel understood and I'm just wondering if I'm being an asshole because I honestly never know. Am I doing the wrong thing? Am I making excuses for people? I honestly don't know and thinking like that makes me feel like even more of an asshole. My mom comes with me to all my psychiatrist appointments, she sees me taking my pills, reminds me even but every time I have one of my depressive episodes she acts like it's not because of the illness itself. I know that I'm not easy to deal with but that's why I need to be told. I need to be told when I'm being too much because if we're both angry it solves nothing. It's always pray on those moods, you shouldn't get angry, why are you sad when you've got nothing to be sad about, you can't be sad about nothing, you can always choose to be happy and my personal favorite, it's all in your head. She hasn't even tried to learn about my condition and when I asked her about it, she kept dodging the question. To me it feels like she's not interested in it at all. It's difficult to understand because it's not as easy to explain as a physical illness so don't understand it all and when I said this she said that she wouldn't be taking me to the psychiatrist if she wasn't interested but isn't that little bit of effort necessary? I know that she's only human. I don't think that she's some kind of all-knowing super human but I'd like to feel like I'm not alone. Like I'm not dealing with alone. Am I being a bad daughter? Overreacting? I'm open to criticism.
If you're still here after all that, I just want to say that I'm sorry for ranting and your opinion will be greatly appreciated."|1
"i feel so empty. i feel regrets for not putting myself out there, making very few friends. i never got invited or went to any parties, or many occasions for that matter. i don't have anything to do this summer cause i have few friends and won't get invited anywhere. 

i never had a gf or even talked to a girl cause i got too much anxiety. i just feel like i'm moving on to 4 more years of school, not much to look foward to. my few friends are talking about their plans for this summer, going to beach week, seeing friends etc and i just feel. so lonely. did anyone feel like this as a senior graduating? i feel so shitty. i've been depressed for years but it's slowly gotten much worse over quarantine and rn i feel awful

in person school kept me mentally sane, i felt like i was part of everyone else. even tho i didn't do anything with people outside of school much. but with online school, i feel like i am detached from everyone else. everyone else did fun things thru out high school and will have fun to do this summer while i'm just... alone

it's my fault. i didn't talk to people , and was too scared to meet new people and make new friends. i wish i didnt."|1
"(F18) I think that's one of the most noticeable ways that I realize I don't care about taking care of myself because, what's the point? I've always aimed to be thin with a healthy weight, maybe learn how to do my makeup, do something to look somewhat decent to people's eyes. But yeah, I guess I have just given up. I barely managed getting out of bed for school and that's online school, that's not even much to do! But I always end up so tired and I loathe the idea of going out, exercising, I just sit and watch stuff in my laptop, have a snack every now and then.

So, I've gained a little more weight throughout the year, mostly on my legs and stomach. Tomorrow I have a semi-formal event and I dreaded going to my closet because I know 95% of my pants won't fit and I can't afford to buy new ones. I place the pants I easily used last year against my figure and they are so small, christ, I shouldn't be so heartbroken because I did this to myself, there is no one else I blame asides myself. At most I have two pairs of pants I bought that I know will fit me because I bought them to purposely be a few sizes bigger. My shirts, now I buy XL sizes so they fit very loose around my body and no one can see the shame that's under it.

I think about telling my mom about all of this that troubles me but I know she would just say 'Well, just lose some weight, it's not that difficult'. I don't know how to explain I have no energy to do anything anymore.

I'm just so disappointed in myself. I just wanted to be seen as pretty. I'm 18 years old and I've never worn a crop top because I am so embarrassed about my body. I just feel so guilty for being so affected with this when other people have it so much worse, they struggle over much worse things. I have no right to be broken over some clothes, right?"|1
Already in my life i have Been betrayed so many times and don’t want to Keep going anymore How am i suposed to live the rest of it|1
does anyone have any advice or tips on how to keep a tidy room when you’re depressed and low energy?? i have major depressive disorder and have depressive episodes often, and i am also chronically ill so it’s hard finding the energy. i share this room with my boyfriend, who i think also struggles with depression, but when i ask him to tidy up or to help me tidy up he gets really angry and says if i have a problem with the mess then i should be the one to clean it because he doesn’t care about it. i want to try keeping the room tidy because it helps me feel less overwhelmed and sad. i plan on buying a trash bin and a few storage bins for the room so i can organize and clean things up. does anyone have anything special they do to make cleaning easier?? 🥲|1
"Do you ever text someone and talk to someone but as you talk to them about your problems you stop to care about them half way through the conversation? I wanna talk about them but I don't know why, I just start to feel like it's pointless.

Honestly I used to think a lot of my problems are pointless (I still do from time to time), and I used to just try to forget about it because I feel like other's problems matter more than mine.

I feel like I'm in a loop right now, I think about the same problems every single day, I do the same thing everyday. I'm alright for 2 hours then I will and lose all will to do anything for 5 hours then I'm okay again then I sleep. I try to break out of the loop, I've done it before but I always end up back where I used to be. Recently a lot of things have been putting me in pain, and it's so hard to shake it off, I've known I've had mental issues for a while now, I wish I could get it diagnosed and treated. I tried talking to my parents about it and they say to pray it off.

I've tried praying it off, but why has God not helped me. I'm almost 17 now and I honestly just want to move out of my house to get the life I want, the help I want, the peace and quiet, a day where I'm by myself and I can relax.

This is just a vent, but thank you for reading. I hope anyone dealing with the same problems as me or worse to get better and to keep your head up. I wish to kill myself too, but the only reason why I won't is the fear, and each day, the fear starts to go away. And I'm so scared that the day there's no more fear, I don't know what I would do to myself.

Honestly I don't know if I'd ever reply to the comments because I don't see a point, but I still appreciate it. I'm just very tired of people pitying me.

I love you all <3"|1
My relationship with the love of my life is on the verge of ending even though we both are madly in love with eachother, my family is extremely religious and other than causing me religious trauma they just suffocate me, additionally my job is a hot mess. How am I supposed to stay positive when relationship, family and work all three suck?|1
"They shoved me in a good private school but never seemed interested in how im doing academically. Zero interest in if i was doing good or bad. I had my own motivations to do well at school and be a mostly A student and not once did i get any recognition of my achievements from my parents. This probably sounds whiney and a stupid thing to be bothered with but i wish i got some praise for my academic success when growing up. At least a “good job” would of been enough. Hell, even some recognition of when i was doing bad would of been something but all i got was complete disinterest 

This post is pointless, sorry for wasting the time of whoever read this"|1
With my depression, I've noticed that now I have trouble concentrating for at least 4 hours in the morning. It's like that half-awake confused period right after you get up stays with me for hours instead of minutes.|1
"Im going in a deep depression that I cant get out of and its a never ending cycle, been depressed off and on for 10 years and I am only 26... Only about 2 years ago accepting that I have a problem, went on meds (cheapest I could afford) as I have no insurance, and they made me gain tons of weight. Cant go back on any other meds cause I cant afford it right now, I tried to apply to a program but got denied cause of my partners income (once bills are paid we are left with just enough for groceries. Lately I have been super depressed and even leaving my home has been a HUGE challenge, lately I would be staying in pajamas all day if I could. But with a toddler hes always begging to go to the park so most days ill only go out cause of him. 

Lately I realized that I am also EXTREMELY under appreciated, I do everything I can push my self to do (clean house, take care of son, take him places, errands etc) and this morning my partner called me the laziest person in the world. Pretty much calling me worthless. He never appreciates me which also pushes me into a deeper depression. I already have so much mom guilt cause I feel like my son deserves better but I am really doing what I can. I can barely get out of bed most days, if it werent for my son pushing me, I would be in bed crying my eyes out everyday cause I am so depressed and so emotional and helpless at this point. No one in my inner circle understands, and assumes things. Makes me just want to keep to myself, even my own parents don’t understand. My partner just says I use my depression to be lazy, which isnt true at all cause I try my best, especially for my son."|1

" So im a 27\[F\] and im just so lost right now. My depression has gotten worse over time. everyday i wake up sad and i dont want to be around anyone or anything anymore. i get mad when my boyfriend or any of my family talks to me, i sigh when i see them calling. I had a hard childhood moving from home to home as my mother wasn't always the best, she is addicted to drugs but i still try and help her best i can, even to this day. i never finished high school because of my home life and the depression started hitting. after i left i locked myself in my house for years and that had me lose all the friends i was barley holding on to.

After a few years i started talking to the guy who is my boyfriend today, we've been together for 7 years now. and to be truthful he deserves to be with someone better since at this point im not sure how i even feel anymore i dont love myself so how can i love someone else? im not sure i love anyone other than my pets at this point. Hes a great guy really. he has a amazing job and is always there to help me, no problem. but im scared i also lost myself in this. im at a point where im finically dependent on him..just dependent in everything really. ive tried getting a job, i had gotten one to be fair but i got scared by the fact i would have to be around people and didn't go. after so long i dont think i would be able to be alone.

Now the friends...i dont have real life friends all my friends are from discord who i talk to everyday. but they treat me like a joke a lot, i feel like im the punching bag to every joke they have and that really hurts i try to not let it get to me but it really does. they always talk about meeting up but i know i never will, that goes back to my fear of people. did i mention im the only female in the group?...i had some female online friends but we got in one argument and that was over.

So to wrap this all up im 27 lost in life. i just want to be happy but im not sure i even know what happy is at this point. ive also recently started getting obsessed over anything to keep my mind off things and thats flipped on me this point too.

Im just not sure what to do anymore."|1
"Can a depressed person have a different perspective due to depression ?
For instance, when depressed the person is not attracted to someone but when not depressed she is."|1
"I have no desire to work in a career or even if I think I do I backtrack and think that maybe I actually don’t. I mean I have interests but I the idea of committing to anything scares me. I don’t really have the will to go back to school and get a masters (I have a BA in psych and have been out of school for 3 years). The thought of going back to school for something I don’t know if I’m fully interested in scares me. I thought maybe I would want to do something with adoptions, so I could get my masters in social work. But then again I don’t really like children, like I feel passionate about adoption as one myself but I also can’t stand children’s or babies. I thought maybe medical billing but do I want to spend thousands on courses for something I feel lukewarm about? Maybe for a better job, but like I won’t be happy. 

I’m just feeling really defeated and that I’m not made for any of this. I’m just better off gone or something. But I don’t want to die cause there are things here I want to experience and little things I’m interested in that I would miss. Of course I would like to make a living doing something I like but I don’t think it’s possible.

If anybody has suggestions or advice, pls share because I’m so lost."|1

How can i forget depression. I tried talking to female friends and they seemed weirded out. The only thing i have is the internet. Idk what to do anymore|1
I'm at this weird point in life where you don't really know where you're going and I wish I could talk to someone about it so they can give me some advice. I don't wanna talk to my friends or family cuz I'd just worry them. I feel so fucking useless because I have been trying, like really trying but I still can't do anything. My best friend is the happiest person ever and I don't want to make her sad by telling her I'm depressed. I don't even know if I'm depressed I haven't even been clinically diagnosed. Fuck, man. The worst part is I have no real reason to be sad. I have shit parents yeah, but they're trying. I have a pretty good life compared to shit other people have gone through and that just makes me feel more miserable because I feel like I don't deserve this life. So I try to get random achievements to prove to myself that I deserve this life. But it's not been working out and I really hate myself for that. I also feel the need to prove myself better than everyone around me, ik that's a toxic trait but yeah. I just want someone to help me or give me some advice on what to do|1
Can I have a break from the thoughts of suicide always lurking in my head. Can I just have one night when I don't think about or feel like self harming. I try so fucking hard every day to just get out of bed. How do I get through this?|1
I went out for a 20 min walk and I can't believe how weak I've become. It hurts to walk. Still, I wonder if it's enough to get me out of bed tommorow... Thank you for listening.|1
"the more I go through, the more I feel distanced from normalcy - and I gravitate towards others who suffer.


not just with depression, but all of our struggles - I truly believe it seperates us from most. not that we're / I'm better - worse in most ways - but that i'm harder to understand and a lot lonelier because of it. 


I do believe that others act better the more they've gone through, while the more privileged hit nerves I didn't have before personal struggle.


does anyone else feel this way?"|1
I'm trying to go to college. I didn't get to go when I was 18 because I was very poor. Now I'm 20 and slightly less poor with a slightly better credit score. I can't get student loans, and without them I can't go to college. I'm never gonna have a job I like if I don't get to go to college. It's all not worth the effort and I hope I did before August so I'm not a disappointment who can't afford college. I just want to die|1
I recently asked my parents for a therapist and he says I have mild depression, depersonalization, derealization and anxiety. I am ok with the dpdr and anxiety I believe that but im scared to accept that I have depression. I feel like if I tell myself I am depressed it would make me miserable and hopeless|1
Tired of trying in this world everything feels useless and I don’t want to live anymore. Constantly feel like I’m trapped in a box while everyone else is living their life.|1
i am 16 years old. i suffer from body dysmorphic disorder, depression and i have an eating disorder that wont go away. recently ive been at my lowest of lows, and its getting so hard to keep going. i have the most supportive family ever and im so grateful for them. my mom and dad love me and they do everything in their power to help me, i feel like i dont deserve them since i am not making any progress and i hate to see them wasting their money on me. i feel like such a burden to this family and i wish i was never born, because i cant build up the courage to kill myself. my body dysmorphia has gotten out of control lately and its exhausting. i constantly have to check mirrors, brush my hair or pick at my skin and chin....these compulsions keep getting worse. i hate myself so much, and its making me insane. my appearance ruins everything. i dont know what i look like anymore but my appearance has ruined all my friendships. i isolate myself at home so no one will have to see me. and when i do go out i am constantly uncomfortable. my school has been supportive during all of this even though ive barely attended these past few months and i feel so guilty. i dont deserve that. i used to have a bunch of friends but now i barely talk to anyonre outside of my family. i have ruined my teen years. i have made no memories with friends. i am so alone. i dont think i can do this anymore. i wish i didnt have such a loving family, if i didnt i would kill myself gladly. i dont want to leave my mom, she would never be the same. im sitting in my room listening to my radiohead vinyl that my dad got me for my birthday. i would tell my parents about my suicidal thoights but the thought of being hospitalised scares me. i dont deserve to be there, and ill be a burden to a larger number of people. i truly dont know what to do right now.|1
"i fucking hate this. i'm a senior in high school, my final exams start in a week and i haven't been studying because i'm so depressed. i was doing so well before, but now when the end is so close i suddenly can't bring myself to do anything. i don't wanna wake up, eat, study. i wish i could just sleep until i died.

i have a chance of leaving my home country and studying in the UK, but it depends on my exam results and i really can't afford to fail, but i feel so bad i want to die. it's like i can just see my future slipping away because my brain doesn't wanna work right. i fucking hate depression."|1
im so sick of being a zombie every day :/ i feel like i just go on auto pilot when im at work and get trapped in my head. im never really fully there. socializing is very difficult dudes|1
"One of my best friends who I've known for round 6 months online is really stressed about work currently and is in his finals. He's also depressed. He hasn't done any self harm that I know of (except biting nails and digging his nails into his skin) but this past month he's been in a really bad place. He doesn't feel anyone cares for him except me, which isn't true as many of his friends that are my friends too care about him. His parents are quite inconsiderate of his feelings and don't know what he's feeling exactly. They're also rather strict so him telling them wouldn't result in them trying to do their best to make him feel better.

The problem is, he's thinking of killing himself after Saturday next week. He has an event on that day and thinks there will be nothing worth living for afterwards. That isn't true and I've explained to him that even though things aren't looking at pretty right now doesn't mean it'll stay like that forever. Some of my other friends have also comforted him about the stress he's been having.

He had said something about killing himself without telling any of his friends, not even a goodbye. Then afterwards said it's messed up, but I feel like despite him saying that there's a chance he could still kill himself.

It will help a lot if anyone could provide me with any advice they can give. If not, thank you still for reading this. I care about him a lot. For clarification, he's in another country from him so the only form of contact I have is online."|1
"I have no idea what is going on. I am so confused. I have hated my life so much up until recently, now I have become the person I’ve always wanted to be in terms of confidence, having a presence in a room etc. 

I guess I looked at this as my life is now starting. Then got more confidence and then think oh ok life has now started. This happened again a few days ago and now I am so confused. I feel as if anything before this just didn’t happen. I have the emotions tied to people, hobbies etc but I don’t know why or how. 

It’s as if I have taken over this body and feel what this body feels but it isn’t mine. I guess to sum it up, I have no idea how the fuck I got here."|1
I am going to reach out to the mods as well, I need medical intervention, how do I turn myself in, I've always struggled with mental health but now it's on a whole new level, I feel like I will end up hurting my family and myself.|1
"I wish I'd turn into a girl. Or live alone to do the one thing I know I love, dressing like one.  But no I'm stuck here fighting a war I'll lose and no one will ever know what I sacrificed or how much suffering I endured.

if someone reads this please tell me what I know. That im pathetic for thinking I could be someone, for thinking someone would care or like me in anyway. Well if you made it that far thanks I guess."|1
Im getting so sick and tired of staying home all day, i go no where at all, i never let it get to me but its too long now and im getting so bored and slightly depressed just being in the house all the time, i dont have friends to hang around in my community and its not like i can go somewhere. Whats kinda worse i have slight ear sensitivity, im 16 i just feel like im wasting my life.|1
I had stopped cutting six months ago. Last night I broke that streak. Seems like the meds help me less and less everyday. I tried opening up to one of my friends and she said to keep it to myself.|1
I am just sort of done with everything at this point. I try to make friends but nothing back, I try to do things which interest me with no positive impact on myself. I dont do anything to help myself but at the same time I am doing all the right things. In the last few months ive messed up 2 relationships.  Im just angry with myself. I am taking it out on the wrong people. Already being in a shitty mood is not helped by the fact I cannot sleep. Fuck man I wish something would change|1
I am extremely lazy. I have potential, health and intelligence, but doing nothing. How can I force myself to do something?|1
"I have had a miserable week, but today was especially bad. I got denied by 3 jobs that I really wanted today. My friend is avoiding me because I’ve been super needy and calling a lot. I’m so broke that I’m gonna have to ask my dad for money. Then the guy I’ve been crushing on told me he would like to be with me, “but not until I’ve fixed myself”, which I can’t blame him for!! I’ve just been having a real shit week. 

Then today for some weird reason I’ve just been super optimistic... I woke up, around 8am, decided I was gonna go make me some coffee and actually did it. Found out I didn’t get the jobs so I Decided to shower, change and then walk the dog. Washed my car, and applied to some jobs. I was able to scrounge up some money and actually paid my phone bill with it! I talked to the really annoying lady at the end of the street instead of darting off and it wasn’t bad...

I made bread! 

This is the best day I’ve had in literal years and I don’t want to sleep and lose it... 😖 but also I feel like if I do try to milk it, it wouldn’t be that good of a memory. 🤣🤷🏻‍♂️"|1
I got a gift for the first time in my life, a new phone, but I didn't feel anything, I don't know why. To preface, I have an okay life, 17, from a lower-middle-class immigrant family in New York City, I've had a phone for about 3 years, and yesterday out of the blue almost, my dad got me a new iPhone. We were talking about getting one the day before but I didn't think he'd actually get me one, but he did. The thing is I'm surprised and startled a bit by my lack of excitement. Like I am and was excited but not as much as I expected. When I got my first phone I was ecstatic, but now I don't really feel anything. I call it a gift for the first time in my life is because the other phone was a hand-me-down. this is the first thing I've gotten without an if or but, don't get me wrong I'm thankful, but I don't know why I am not excited. I don't know if this is depression, but I feel that the possibility is there.|1
Sometimes a hug sounds nice more than anything|1
"I still have my parents who are very supportive.

I have (or used to have) friends who are genuine friends and not the backstabbing kind.

Most people I’ve met in life are actually nice and really want to help me.

Money is not a problem. 

The country I’m from could be better but it’s not that bad. 

Reflecting back, everything’s not perfect but it’s still perfectly fine.

But why do I feel so bad about myself? I feel that I can’t blame anyone but myself."|1
"I've been doing good. I've been eating relatively well, sleeping well, and have left some stress since finals are over...
But I am tired. 
I don't want to see the sun. I don't want to see anything. Or anyone. 
I just wanna sleep.


And it doesn't help that my dreams keep trying to hurt me. They like to poke fun at me, remind me how alone I really am, and make me feel so damn alone and useless and unwanted. 


It upsets me. Puts me in a bad mood. I want to just lay around and sleep, since apparently nobody needs anything from me. 
But I still need to eat. And drink water. And move around. And go to work later. 
And I find that if I just stay awake and mope instead, I can do something with that feeling that might help me. 
If only breaking glass bottles onto the pavement were allowed..."|1
I’m 18 years old and I’m truly fed up with life. I wake up in the morning and I’m so angry to not have killed myself the day before. I truly do not want to do any of this anymore. Everyone is so mean and fake. I’m graduating over a month and I don’t care at all. I took 2 pills and I know it wasn’t going to do anything, but I’m epileptic so if I take more I might have an attack or something. I don’t know why I’m writing this.|1
"So... I always have this habit that whenever the calendar strikes at the 28th day of every month, I had this very strong feeling that makes me sad. I don't know why it happened but I started noticing that every28th day of everymonth, I feel so down even when I'm super jolly at daytime and even if there's no reason to be sad. I'm tired of feeling this way but well, I cannot tell my feelings to everyone so here I am, hiding my profile. I cannot tell my parents about this because when I tried, they just told me that ""you have no reason to be sad and stop being so dramatic"". Yerp! That hurt me but well, I guess I just have myself because my bestfriend just blocked me haha so fun to be alive."|1
Ever since my dad died I have lost all interest in living. Everything feels pointless and I don't want to be here anymore. What is the most painless and quickest way to go? Is death by poisoning easy to do?|1
"I'm 30 years old. I have a GF of 7 years. And a 1 year old daughter. My daughter is hard work. She won't come to me. Just winges all day for her Mom. I play with her, cuddle her, read to her and I get the odd feedback but it's mostly met with crying and pushing away. 

We currently live in my parents due to saving for a house, my daughter sleeps in our bed. So me and my GF barely touch each other. No kissing, cuddling definitely no sex. I work from home due to the pandemic so I basically live in my bedroom. My GF knows about my depression but doesn't know on the scale of it. She tells me not to let it get to me but it does.

Due to my loneliness and sadness I found a site on Reddit called Bi Curious. I've never had any attraction to Guys but all of a sudden I've found myself on there and letting them flirt with me and I'll be honest I've jacked off over Kik with a few off them as well and Roleplayed. I don't even know why I've done this apart from the taboo and just a need to feel wanted by absolutely anyone. I keep being pushed away and I can't even cry. I tried last week and I had a little sob and was back downstairs trying to put on a brave face. 


I just feel like walking to a bridge and jumping off just as a passing car comes. Done. Over. Freedom.

Thank you for reading if you got this far."|1
I’ve been taking Prozac for a month or so now to help with my social & generalized anxiety as well as depression. I feel that it has helped alleviate the butterflies in my stomach that I would always get when in certain social situations. However, I am still so in my head about what I’m going to say or what I should say. I feel I can’t focus my full attention on the conversation or the person I’m talking to, as I’m not confident in what I’m thinking. My mind goes blank, and I can’t think fast enough, and it hard to focus or remember things sometimes. I want to be able to speak my mind without this filter that handicaps my thinking, similar to how i can get loose after a few drinks and things seem to flow way better. I think maybe a stimulant would help me think faster and more clearly and help remove the filter I put on myself. Has anyone had any promise using stimulants in conjunction with antidepressants?|1
I don’t know what’s been going on lately.I just feel so empty and feel like theres nobody there to help me or to talk to.I feel like everyone has their backs turned and have been feeling so down lately.Is this normal??|1
"I’m a licensed massage therapist working for a franchise and am generally able to show up and do my job, even on the hard days. However, every once and awhile I have a major panic attack and/or depressive episode and come to the conclusion I need to call in. (Like today where I am still completely undressed and unable to get out of my bed without having a breakdown)
I try to be respectful of my manager but it’s getting really hard. 
She guilt trips her employees when they call in or ask for time off. 
I did not feel comfortable telling her my exact situation due to the fact that it’s none of her business and I’m not ok telling her I’m seriously considering taking myself to the hospital at this point. 
Shortly after my message saying I cannot come in today due to circumstances beyond my control (It’s not a lie) she has been bothering me about coming in on a day I’m not scheduled to make up for the people I had to cancel on today. I actually cannot come in on my days off as I am working and doing other personal appointments on those days.

My question is how do you all deal with difficult managers when your mental health becomes a real struggle?"|1
i literally just had roblox sex it was the best lmaoo|1
"Trigger warning: Suicide

I’m about to start a new antidepressant. I’ve already been taking Remeron, nowadays it’s completely useless, or maybe my depression got bad and it’s just not enough.

I’m in a situation that will require a lot of willpower and emotional resilience to get out of. I have gender dysphoria. I have a small amount of student debt. I failed college and my parents don’t know it, and they aren’t exactly calm and rational people, especially my dad, who has the emotional maturity of a 14 year old hormonal teenager. I need to get a job so I can move out, start transitioning, and save enough money to get back to school. Even the best min wage jobs are 12 hours a day-6 days per week, and min wage is rapidly losing it’s already small value against the skyrocketing inflation. I will have to somehow save enough money, not get fired from my job because I’m trans, get back to school, do all of it. On top of that I have IBS which doesn’t allow me to leave home without calculating the time required to get back in case I have to use the toilet. The entire day my stomach hurts. I’m nauseous all the time. And I’m constipated. And I my emotional/physical resilience is very low, which I guess is the reason I’m in this situation in the first place. I have to leave the country, it’s very dangerous for trans people here. I’m absolutely hopeless, and I have no confidence in myself.

Every night I pray to whatever god or deity or whatever else is up there to kill me in my sleep. Every night I wish to not make it to the morning. I dream of death every night.

Maybe this is easy for other people. Maybe a normal person can handle this. I can’t handle this. I can’t keep going.

My psychiatrist gave me a new antidepressant, Effexor XR. I’m hoping it will make me tougher. However it has a lot of side effects, especially gastrointestinal side effects. Also, like nearly all antidepressants, it can make things worse before starting to work. I haven’t started taking it yet.

Right now, I’m getting 6k steps per day. I’m pushing myself to get out of home, to go further so I can get used to stay outside. I try to shower every 3-4 days as opposed to 3 weeks. I started brushing my teeth. I feel like shit. Every night I say to myself, “I surrender. That’s all I got.” and then my brain says “Nope. You can’t. You have to keep going. There is no more time you can spend in your comfort zone. No pills will make your IBS better. Ignoring your gender dysphoria is not working anymore. You have student loan payments coming up. You need to get back to school. You need to leave the country. You cannot waste any more time, there is none left. Surrendering, going back to your comfort zone is not an option. You have to keep pushing.”

So every day I drag my sorry ass outside to walk. I push myself to shower as often as possible. I try get my sleeping back on schedule. I brush my teeth. I eat very little to lose weight so I’m healthy enough to start transitioning. And also because it helps my IBS.

And every night I wish to die. I wish to never exist. I have no real life friends to have a face to face, honest conversation. If I talk to my family they will reject me.

But I’m also putting the effort. The effort I’m putting is not nearly enough, I have to do so much more. My brain is alert all the time. Anticipating pain and suffering. My entire world feels like its collapsing.

But the effort I’m putting in, this is the first time I came so far. I’ve lost more than 20 pounds in 1 month. I brush my teeth every day. I get out every day for a brisk walk.

And I want to start Effexor because I need the resilience it could give to me, because I will need to do more.

But I’m also scared. I’m scared of nausea, stomach cramps, constipation. I’m also scared because it can make my depression and anxiety even worse. Over a decade of trying and failing, this is the first time I’ve been able to lose that much weight, get out of home consistently, and improve and keep my hygiene for so long.

Don’t get me wrong. This is not willpower. I have no willpower. I’m an immature man-baby. I have no resilience. These decisions are made out of desperation, not by my own will. It’s very humiliating to admit but if I wasn’t so desperate I would just stay in my comfort zone. I’m not forcing myself out of my comfort zone; I’m being forced out of it.

And I’m scared that effexor will take that away from me. I’m scared that it will make things worse. I’m scared that it will make me even more anxious/depressed/suicidal, and lose the best hope that I had in a decade. In all those years, I feel like this is the first time I got this feeling, “I’m going to make it.”

But I also need Remeron. Because I need to keep going. I need to do much more. I need to push much, much harder. I will have to make much tougher decisions.

I don’t know what to do. I’m currently prepping for Effexor. My psych said she didn’t want to lose any time and prescribed me 150mg as starting dose. I know I can’t take that much of an antidepressant that is notorious for it’s side effects while starting-stopping. So I decided to get 37.5mg and push it to 150mg as fast as I comfortably can. I got Zofran in case I get too nauseous. I’m taking Lactulose to make sure that I’m empty in case it irritates my intestines and because I heard one side effect of Effexor is constipation.

But, I don’t know if I’m making the right decision. I can’t think clearly. I don’t know if I’m going to take the leap."|1
I think about offing myself every day and for my own reasons I don’t nobody knows about this because I keep it to myself but when someone close to you calls you just to say they hope you get in a car accident is that a validation to go through with it now that I’m not the only one who thinks the world would be better off without me|1
Don't really know what else to say. Just wish I could escape.|1
I don’t feel like there’s much for me here anymore. All I do is hurt people and I don’t even do it on purpose. I think I’m just naturally a bad person. I feel like everyday is the same. I wake up at 7 pm, hate myself, do drugs then repeat. I feel alone yet I have people it doesn’t stop. It feels like the pain won’t ever end. I cry almost every day because the pain is too much to take. I can’t take this anymore. I want to die but I’m afraid to kill myself cause of my friends and family. Dying is the only way out from this pain. I can’t tell people how I feel cause it brings everyone’s mood down. My boyfriend knows but I try not to tell him because I don’t want him to be sad that I wanna die. I don’t deserve friends or love cause I hurt everyone who cares. Nothing will ever change|1
"I don't know if anyone has a similar problem, but working from home is so exhausting for me.

I work on a desk right next to my bed and therefore I usually would give up very quickly, get away from my computer and cry in bed.
The barrier to giving up is literally non-existent.

At the end of the day, I've worked for 2-3 hours..."|1
"I remember I would always hear people say ""don't focus on the people that bullied you, after high school, they don't go anywhere with their lives."" I used to think that was complete bullshit and it would make me angry. I knew that their bullying was going to cause me trauma moving forward and fuck with my potential to succeed. But they were kind of right. The people that bullied me, went nowhere with their lives. They just work at Mcdonalds and that's it.   


Life used to fucking suck, but it feels good knowing that it's gotten better for me and worse for those that made my life miserable. Try to keep going to just see their lives go downhill. It's a nice feeling."|1
Family gatherings always twist me into knots.|1
"I have a great job, love my job. On 150k plus a year.

Been in therapy for a few years, great therapist, can’t believe I had such luck finding him.

Loving grandparents who mean everything to me and i to them

A few friends not heaps but a few I can rely on.

I’m healthy, I work out most days.

And i lie here at 4 in the morning - been awake for 3 hours just crying. Wanting the pain to end. Every day I think about suicide. Every fucking day. What right do I have? My own mind is so ungrateful and it makes me feel worse... once my grandperants die I can finally end it all"|1
"***(Thought** apologize for the typo)***

Every second since the tragic events of the last year finally settled down, has been filled with painful recollection. Funny enough, the pandemic was perhaps the least traumatic experience for me in the past year. First off, I had a horrific back injury that left me bedridden and in 20/10 pain (got surgery and am doing well now). Immediately after that, I revealed the true disturbing nature of my OCD to my very close friend and she told me that our friendship would be different from now on. I got mad and neurotic in the middle of an OCD episode and texted her like an insane person asking her why. She and our other friend were the best things that happened to me in my life. I had real friends for the first time.

After I kind of took it out on her, she decided that she could no longer be friends with me. 7 years of friendship, literally gone within a week. My heart shattered and I almost bought a knife to rip myself open with. I didn’t, and I’m slowly getting better. But every day, the lasting pain of her being gone just beats me into submission. 

After this, my sister lost one of the babies she was pregnant with. She was with us as a family when it happened. We were at the mall, and I’m away from them in the food court eating. I get a text that my sister is bleeding. The first thing running through my mind is that she is losing that baby. I start begging for that to not be the case, but it was. Fortunately, she had twins so there is still one that is growing. Also, that baby was apparently not growing properly, so we couldn’t have stopped it. 

All of this has basically just ripped my mind and soul into pieces. Summer 2019 was perhaps the happiest time of my life, now, I have lost everything that made that time in my life happy. I feel as though I’m cursed and I deserve this pain. I hurt my friend, I hurt my family by being a lazy shit in general, what’s the benefit of me breathing? 
I’m really just lost in my mind."|1
I’ve been on and off depressed for the past few years. But for a few months I’ve just felt strange. Like nothing is hitting the spot. I’ve been overeating but every meal I eat feels like a miss and doesn’t satisfy me. I jerk off and I feel unsatisfied after. I watch YouTube videos and movies for hours and never feel satisfied with what I’ve watched. I go to work and it feels like I’m missing something. I just feel like things aren’t “hitting the spot” like I’m scratching right next to an itch but not on it. I don’t know if it’s anhedonia because I do get excited to do things (slightly excited but still) but when I do those things they just don’t hit the spot, idk how else to say it. Any advice?|1
I feel numb. I feel disconnected from everything around me. I could care less about what people do or why they do what they do everyday. I don’t find any enjoyment in being present or assertive  or even contributing in a social context. Everything lost all meaning. What do I do? Everything that comes out my mouth is stained by this grim outlook I have on the world. Nobody likes what I say from my heart with complete honesty. I know people only wanna hear what they like, but I can’t be actively people pleasing. I just don’t care. I don’t find joy in working out, in going out, hell even vices don’t excite me. I’m just a body floating in this thing called life for an unknown reason doing what seems to be random things. Sometimes I cheer myself up and find a bit of meaning to life and convince myself to pursue things and get better and be competitive, but the next day I wake up and I’m like, why? Sometimes I actually wanna break against this tide consciously, but don’t find the energy. Nothing makes sense anymore. I don’t see where all these humans get the drive to keep living everyday like a challenge. I feel like the only challenge there is is that to comply and act like everybody else dod the things others expect you to do and then brag about it because, otherwise it doesn’t even count. Not sure where to go from here, It’s not like I wanna end it but I wanna be alone and not have to interact with everyone else, which apparently doesn’t get you that far in life. So what to do?|1
"Hey!

First of all, i don’t even know why i’m asking this here, but i guess the community is really friendly so...yeah.

Now, i’ll just explain why i don’t want to be friends with these people. 
A primary reason would be the fact that they don’t respect women, queer people and people with disabilities. They’re homophobic, racist, sexist, xenophobic and other terms like this. I was always pro gender equality and i always supported feminism and other movements. They always joke about asian people, black people, gay people( i’m bisexual btw) and whenever they see a person with disabilities they laugh. I don’t know why i even know these people. They’re soo fuckin toxic for me and my mental health.
So, do i just tell them to fuck off? what do i do?

Thank you! Every single positive advice will help me!"|1

"Rarely when I have gone out with ""friends"", I was mostly seen as the funny confident guy and someone who takes initiative first in a group, not even being drunk. I have also been told by guys and girls to be good-looking and in great shape. Yet since age 12 I have been having episodes of crippling depression and loneliness and never talked to anyone about it. In these I would lose interest in everything and being alone I would sometimes punch against the wall or cry in frustration and anger or exercise to the point of almost getting a heart attack. Don´t compare yourself to others, what you believe them to be is just a tiny part if not fake."|1
"when someone says things about them and their parents having similar interests, doing things together, having vulnerable moments together ect gives me a massive rush of intense emotions like anxiety, jealousy, anger, self-hatred, hopelessness, and a lot more. it just makes me think nonononono please no... dont make me even think about talking with parents or needing to be with them. sometimes it'll send me down into a spiral of emotions and i'll be stuck crying hysterically and unable to form sentences while thoughts swirl around in my head and then feeling like ive lost control of my body and like im drifting into a chaotic void of confusion and emptiness for the next hour.

"I'm 27 M and just don't know what to do with LIFE anymore. I'm posting this here because I want some serious HELP. I'm a multiple serious suicide attempt survivor. I don't know if I'm lucky or unlucky but yeah. Since school I was abused by my father and in school mentally and physically. My father suffers from Bipolar disorder and he has very unstable mind which is why our house is just a house not a home. In 2014 I said to my parents I'm going to suicide give me some money, they handed me some and they just went out. I attempted. Was in emergency room. It's like my parents literally once helped me in suicide by closing doors and telling do whatever you want to. I said parents because even my mother can't make good decisions of everyday life. I said I want to get a career in arts but they forced and manipulated to get me into engineering just to show pride (human nature I understand but). They literally held me psychiatric hospital with fake papers from police and even court by bribing them (I'm saying this because they gave it in front of me, and told to act dumb in front of magesty). In 2015 I told them I'd get a good career of my choice but they faked that government and police has banned me and told them to keep an eye on me (I understand because I was suicidal) but this was and is happening on everyday basis. I've no friends, no relative asks for me, no good parents, neighbours won't talk to me, no society I can ask for help. I wanted and to do psychology as a career. And this corona pandemic has made life worse. What should I do...? I do want to live but literally can't. I feel no fear, no depression, no happiness nothing.   Feeling suicidal again. It's like ""it's better to live 1 day than going through all the hell of nothingness""."|1

"
(Sorry if this is a bit of a rant, it's not worth reading to be honest so feel free not to) 

I literally have nothing to be depressed about. 

So many people have much much worse lives than me, I feel like i don't have the right to be fucking depressed. But I literally can't find happiness in anything, hate myself more than I've hated anyone, and all I want is to kill myself. Feel like there's absolutely no point in anything, like I'm dead inside already. I can't stop sabotaging my own life, fucking up exams, pushing away people who care about me because them being nice to me makes me hate myself even more. I'm constantly haunted by suicidal thoughts, can't sleep at night, hear voices in my head calling me names all the time telling me I don't deserve the life I have. 

But all I am is being fucking ungrateful for all the things I have. I don't have the right to be depressed and being depressed only makes me hate myself more. Its a vicious cycle."|1
I hate my body. I want to be able to look in the mirror and finally be happy. I’m gaining so much weight, I’m insanely mentally ill, I can’t even recognize myself anymore. I wish I could go back to being underweight. My sister is 110 pounds, why can’t I be that too? I wish I looked like her. She is perfect and I’m useless|1
"I can't move. I don't to do this anymore. I'm so tired of everything and having to make everyone happy, only to listen to them criticise me.

I wish I could feel something. I'm always so empty and sometimes I can physically feel how empty I am, like there's nothing in me worth keeping alive. I feel so drained all the time. Everyone around me has happy faces and i wonder why I couldn't turn out like them.

Why am I so miserable all the time? I don't wanna cry about nothing all the time. I wish I could get out of bed and make something of myself or actually get some work done. It feels like the world is passing by and everyone's getting things done and having a good time while I'm stuck in the same spot I was 9 years ago, numb, tired, emotionless, and miserable. 

I feel unlovable and I know I deserve it because at times, i have no love to give. I'm too tired to love myself let alone anyone else. It makes me feel worthless.

I'm so tired of everything."|1

Five more years until I’m 30, I go back and forth everyday wondering if I should go back to school or not to get a degree so I won’t be working minimum wage jobs anymore, I have a uncurable STI (so more than likely won’t/can’t have another relationship in my life or kids), credit is bad, why am I even here anymore? I hate my life and the decisions that I’ve made that I can’t undue. Only reason I haven’t killed myself yet is because I’m too scared and I don’t a good plan yet..|1
I cry every day thinking about how much of a mistake I really am.|1
"New to reddit. Sorry if this is a bit rambly. 

I've had depression for a long time, years. I didn't really do anything about it in high school. I had few friends, and most of the ones I did have were incredibly toxic and downright traumatic for me to have known (they had very strange beliefs, which at the time I didn't take as seriously as I should have, but to put it simply, they were very cultish and bizzare. I never shared their beliefs, but I played along because I apparently didn't know any better). The couple of friends I did and still have that were real friends to me, I would occasionally confide in, mostly because they could relate to my feelings of sadness and helplessness. I never much confided in my mother, because I feared her having an extreme reaction to my feelings. 

By the time I had finished high school and started college, I had developed strong social anxiety. I couldn't bring myself to talk to strangers. I have only made two friends in college; my roommate, who I would likely never had made friends with if I hadn't been forced upon her, and my roommate's friend, who I still barely know after three years and struggle hard to connect with. 

I was doing okay. I had good grades. I was stressed and sad most of the time, but I could keep it down with plesant distractions. I felt disconnected with my peers and my friends, but at least I HAD friends. I kept my sadness and bad thoughts to myself, except for jokes and making light of it as a way to cope. 

About two years ago, I began to really decline. My sadness started to turn into a sort of numbness. Lighthearted jokes aimed at me began to hurt, bad, in a way it had never bothered me before- I had two meltdowns/ panic attacks over it. It started to really bother me that I couldn't seem to connect to anyone in a meaningful way anymore. Feelings about things that always bothered me about myself or my behavior towards others amplified. I started medication, which I've had switched three times already, none of which had really worked. 

When covid hit, and school shut down in person, it got worse. I lost my motivation to do anything, especially the things I was supposed to be doing. I began failing classes, because I no longer had the fear of peers being there to see me fail, which was probably the only thing at that point keeping mg grades up. I had the worst mental breakdown I'd ever had. Started therapy, which hasn't yet worked the way I need it to. After starting therapy, I began to do somewhat better in classes because of pressure by my mother, but I would still do poorly in at least one per quarter, only some of which I would tell my mother about. 

I never recovered from my breakdown. I still have zero motivation. I ghost my friends. I'm not sure I'll ever do better again. All I want to do is sleep, or distract myself. If I spend even a second alone with my thoughts, I start to cry. If my family brings up my school, I want to cry. I've lost interest in almost everything I used to love to do, including the thing I go to school for. I'm so afraid of my friends and family finding out about just how big of a failure I've become in all aspects of my life. I don't what to do anymore. I want to finish school, I want to stop feeling the way I do. I used to have dreams. I want to start caring enough about my self and start caring again about the things in my life, but I don't care about anything anymore. I thought seeing myself become a failure would make me care again, but it hasn't. 

How do I pull myself back up from rock bottom? How do I start caring again? I can't continue mentally coasting through my life like this. I need to do something, but I don't know what. I don't want to be a failure in life. I'm exhausted. 

To anyone who leaves a comment, thank you."|1
Do you leave people once they get married or have a kid?I do, I feel like they don't need me anymore or I'm too shamed to be with them.|1

"Hi,

I'm new here, looking for for people to connect with. Long-term sufferer of mild-moderate depression and anxiety since 2004. Currently 37 and living with my parents, teaching music part time but also procrastinating over looking for more work. Getting therapy through BetterHelp but no medication (the last few drugs made me worse - horrible anxiety and insomnia). Need to get my thoughts out.

Just split up with a woman, which started as a long distance online friendship - I'd only had one previous 6-month relationship so very inexperienced, still feel like a naive teenager emotionally. I was desperate for a relationship this year, and tried to make this work but I wasn't feeling that strongly about her. Kept being a bit hot and cold due to mood swings, we tried being just friends then getting intimate again, but it felt like I was a fraud, leading her on when I wasn't that into her - but was that really lack of connection/chemistry or just the depression talking? She said she's still willing to stay friends, but I need space and time. Feel like a bastard for treating her like this but at least I wasn't abusive, or cheating on her. But also feel regret for ending things, like there was a 20% chance we could make something work, and the good times showed I can feel positive feelings, when before I was suffering from anhedonia. It's a learning experience for both of us.
There is hope - I'm not giving up yet."|1
"*warning* long and boring. This is how my brain functions. So sorry. 







This is letter I wrote while drunk. Not very drunk, somehow this happened after one beer. Been a weird month. It's a confession, i guess. It's also incredibly long, and incredibly boring and I'm so sorry because I don't want to bother anyone literally ever. I mean, honestly run me over yikes sorry for getting blood on your wheels. 
This letter is meant for my therapist. I'm starting a new job tomorrow. I'm in recovery from depression, anxiety, social anxiety, health anxiety, and some obsessive stuff. 
This is a night in my brain. It's incredibly personal. And I need him to see it. And I'm so terrified that on Tuesday I'm gonna chicken out and not give him this. So here goes. Please, don't read this if you are sensitive about topics like mental health, intrusive thought etc... don't hurt yourself over this it's a stupid monologue inside my brain and it's insane. 







You see the thing is I'm thinking a lot. Like, obsessively. Constantly, about so many things at once. I try to distract myself and it comes right back. I jump from question to question. 

Wanna see my search history? 
It started with vampirism. And it went on for a WHILE. Vampirism, it is apparently a real disorder, commonly known as Reinfeld's Syndrome. Then I wanted to know what a syndrome was. Was it a disorder? Yes, as far as Google says. So then, the question is are these people just ill and need actual help? Why aren't we helping them? But then, is a disorder an illness? I start to question everything. Some deep research lead me to conclude that some use mental disorder and mental illness interchangeably. As far as I can tell, and with what makes most sense to me, they are the same but one is more serious than the other. As far as I can tell. So then. If they're the same thing, can any disorder be cured? No, the term employed is never cured. The term employed is ""treated"". So. A disorder can be treated. 
Wait a second. What kind of disorder is psychopathy. No clear answer. Then, what's the difference between psychopaths and sociopaths?The first article I read says they are the same thing, on a different scale, and belong under the umbrella term ""anti social personality disorder"". 
Disorder. So it can be treated. Has a psychopath ever been diagnosed, and treated? Has it? Everything starts to be a bit much. Who would want to help a psychopath? Someone who hurts, for fun  who enjoys it, who doesn't feel an ounce of regret. I don't think I'm a very good person. 

Oh yeah, just so you know, this entry is gonna be an info dump. This is what happens in my brain. So fast. 

Then for some reason I moved on to video games. Stuff I want to play. That seem so interesting and rich. Boom, 5 new pinned tabs on Chrome. 

Suddenly, Game of thrones. Yes, I know that sounds insane. Keep up. Boom, every single book George R R Martin has ever written is in my kindle. Do you know how many books that is? More than 50. Yeah, the dude never stops writing. Seriously. I've started and I can't stop. I'm actually glad about this obsession. I haven't been obsessed about a book since I was 14. And even though I don't read beneath my blanket like I used to, thinking my mom didn't know I had my torch under there with me. Of course she knew. But who would scold a kid who likes to read every night until midnight? 
It's healthy. I've missed it. 

Ooooh man here comes the astrology obsession. I'm an actual nightmare. Suddenly I'm making a list of the people I love and what zodiac sign they are. I think this entire thing, you're welcome for jumping to conclusions on this superb tale, is because I want to believe in something. I'm a dreamer and that's actually insane. That's insane. And I know it's insane. No, true love doesn't exist, but maybe it does. What the hell do I know. Yeah, fuck it, i know love is just chemicals, love at first sight is actually lust at first sight and all that bla bla but I believe there is someone out there who will love me and do right by me. I need to believe in that. So yeah. That's the conclusion. I'm a contradiction in a hell of a lot of different ways and I don't know who I am in the slightest. Maybe you can tell me that?? Is that cool is that a thing psychologists can do for you??? Thanks dude. 

Then came a very funny moment where I googled ""do I have ocd"" 

Went back to game of thrones for a bit. Decided I hated everyone involved in the making of season 8. 

That's it. That's all it is. Maybe it's not that much thinking really. Maybe it's just all at the same time. Sometimes I think I go a bit nuts. I step out of reality. I've always done it. I didn't realise it was a problem until last November. It's why when I touched things, I always felt like I couldn't really FEEL it. I could feel it but I wanted to feel it more. I think I just really like feeling things. There's nothing worse than the numbness. But the thing is that it comes. I don't know where it comes from, I think it comes from my stomach. I remember sitting on a chair one day at the hospital. Can't remember who was there. Can't remember anything about what was going on around me. All I could feel was a pit. I could feel it, I felt like I wanted to throw it up. Just scream it out god sometimes I just wanna scream it out of me.

Another conclusion I came to somehow by just thinking to myself, in some weird messed up labyrinth sort of way : 
I never forgave younger me for her mistakes. She was my worst enemy. Now she's part of the gang. Leading me to realize that future me is also me. Meaning... Man meaning I separated myself from young me, and that's why I separate myself from future me. 
I also at some point concluded that I might be tougher than I think I am, and better than I think I am. I woke up. At 8:30. Immediately went into the shower, had a cup of coffee, called the restaurant, got my try at the job for tomorrow. I did that. In an hour and a half. Dude it takes me 45 minutes to actually be awake. I did it anyway. It may sound crazy but isn't that a really good thing? Compared to past me (it's okay past me), this is good. 

I concluded I'm a dreamer and that's okay. I'm emotional and that okay. It doesn't mean I'm not rational either. I'm a realistic optimist. A depressed dreamer. Figure that out. 


I don't know if I'll be talking about all this with you tomorrow. I hope so, maybe it would do me some good. Maybe. 
I think I need someone to completely understand me. To relate, I feel alone. I hadn't realised I felt alone. 

I'm so scared of saying it but I need someone to hear this. And to understand me. Please. This is me at my most vulnerable, my darkest and my most terrified. I am so scared of saying I need help. 
I'm tired of being my own shrink"|1
Anytime I make a mistake in life or lose at video games I feel like the worst person in the world and that I don’t deserve to live. I’ve been through so much that I believe that no matter what happens I can’t be slightly better. I am actually damaged and there’s nothing I can do. Anytime something tiny goes right it goes back to being wrong. I’m not normal. I’ve been hurt by almost everybody I know. I don’t think there’s a point to life if everybody just wants to hurt me. I’m not good at anything. I can’t even tell myself positive things because then it’ll only hurt me more and I mean physically. I don’t think I’ll ever be helped. I’m worthless. I’m helpless. Thinking opposite will only hurt me more and there isn’t much I can do about it. Maybe the right thing is to give up on trying and realize that I’ll always be nothing and a worthless failure.|1

"Title.

Ive been depressed for years now, recently got out of a catatonic state where I could only think of killing myself or mutilating my body. And I think I'm sinking back into it again. 

I've been having vivid almost hallucinations of screaming at the top of my lungs to the point where i start coughing up blood, and punching windows or mirrors till my knuckles gush blood, and ripping my braces from my teeth and drowning in my own blood.

And I've started caring less and less about my personal creative endeavors. I just can't seem to care about the characters and worlds I've created and written, it all just seems pointless to me. Watching TV isn't fun anymore, and not even being with my cats is enjoyable enough, they always make me sad when I look at them and know that they care for me in some way shape or form.

And I can't kill myself because my mom will think that it was her fault and I can't give her all of that guilt either. I can't afford to hurt her anymore, even if I die.

I just don't know what to do anymore."|1
I’ve been noticing more and more, especially since the COVID thing is starting to go away, people don’t have personalities outside of what they do for work. Families come around and the only thing they ask about is “are you working? You making money?”. Nobody cares about anything else. Just work your life away. If you’re lucky enough to live to a certain age maybe you can retire then enjoy your life. If you have the money at least. If not get more jobs and work til you’re dead. What’s the point? I guess you could take a vacation. But fuck you if you don’t have the money. How do you enjoy life if all you do is work, talk about work, think about the next way you’re going to make money. I feel like it never ends and it’s driving me crazy.|1

"This year has been hard on everyone im sure. But literally this past week has been a total nightmare for us. Started off this week with her losing her mom on Sunday(it was very sudden).

"I recently went to this mental hospital which caused me more stress than help. (I only stayed for 4 days because i got attacked and they treated us like prisoners there.)

I recently ended a pretty toxic 7 year relationship. My ex was bad but I found out he was seeing someone else. Doing everything I wished he’d done for me. All while I was in and out of hospital. I went for surgery too. I saw pics of what he was doing for his new gf. Her friends were sending DMs tormenting me, but of course he chose to believe them. Then he said he hoped he die. I got super worried so I texted his best friend to check up on him. My ex saw it as spying and accused me of being revolting. I couldn’t take it so I overdosed. And did it again recently. My mum has been trying to reach out to him but he never responded. I feel like I wasted 7 years of my life. I just want it all to end. All I wanted was to be friends in the end. Everyone knows ending a long term relationship isn’t easy. And with covid restrictions I couldn’t even leave my house.|1
"Late night thoughts are never very pleasant for me. So I wanted to write something that I can look at when I’m having these unpleasant thoughts to maybe make me feel better and thought maybe someone else may relate or get something out of what I say.

This past year has felt like a total war for me trying to keep my head above the water. However, in my darkest moments there’s one thing that keeps me going and that is that I want to see my unedited ending and life.

Life is so so hard at times and I wonder if it’s worth it. However I think that I’ve come to the conclusion that even if it isn’t, I want to see what happens. Even if I’m so depressed that I can’t get up I want the opportunity to be able to. These opportunities don’t have to be life altering, I don’t have to be a 100% happy, but just being able to fill it out is something I want to do. My thing is going to the thrift store on Tuesday, when everything is 50 cents, and that has gotten me far.... just a little something to look forward to each week. I would miss these little moments if I was gone. Even though I am alone I am growing and I want to see my story to the end. If I was gone maybe I would miss a great find at the thrift store, a funny joke from a family member, trying a new food, just the little things.

Even if my story is the crappiest story to ever exist at least I was there to experience it, in my mind leaving would stop the pain but I can’t lose my hope that maybe my story has a happy ending.

I know this may not be a popular outlook but it’s currently the only thing keeping me going."|1
"I have known for several years I do not know how to make friends and keep friends. 

  Anyone who has ever been nice to me for more than a day generally wants something. No one I have ever tried to be friends really reciprocated. Which while part of me can understand, I'm not a particularly interesting person, I don't pick up on nonverbal or passive aggressive ques, and hearing my name come out of someone else's mouth sends me into utter panic. I am sure there is a laundry list people I went to high-school and college could provide but those are ones that stand out to me personally.  It's always been an issue but since covid-19, I've realized it's gotten worse. Maybe it's the isolation or maybe it was always this bad an Im just now noticing the physical reactions and feelings of fear that come when I hear my name. 

So beyond meeting people how do people make and maintain friends.

 Just wanted to add before people say work, I work from home did so even pre pandemic, so while we have meetings using online meeting for work software none of us even live in the same state so it's ruled out even more. I've tried working more shifts just to keep my mind occupied but I'm maxed out each week and still just stuck with my thoughts."|1
I literally can't i wake up go to online school barley eat i get criticized by my parents for being so lazy when no im just depressed an mentally drained. I had an ex who i thought felt the same way i did but no just short lived loved bcs she cheated an it fucked me up bcs i thought she was the one. I cant get out the house to meet new people. I have suicidal thoughts day in day out. I wake up every morning with not one person caring i could dissapear an they would think im in my room still. I try but nothing works i have a shitty relationship with my family so my room is my only escape but my prison too|1
"I'm annoying, I can't tell where to draw the line between acting normal and acting weird. I don't understand anything. How can everyone act do normal. Why do I keep making these mistakes. I just want to be a good person, to be an average member of society that everyone can come to for a chat and enjoy it. But no I'm a freak clearly. I don't know what's wrong with me. I feel like everyone secretly thinks I'm annoying or even I'm crazy and they secretly hate me. Maybe just I think that I don't even know anymore it's so confusing. I just want someone to understand me, or maybe to even be proud of me, because I try so hard every day, but I get nowhere. Istg there is a new problem everywhere I turn, it's overwhelming. Everyone else just gets on with their daily lives. It probably seems like I'm making a bigger deal than I need to about this.

Yh, I hope you enjoyed the rant."|1
Im 18 years old and life have turned on its head since 2018. I dont want to get deep into a story but I lost family, friends, job, and a job want most importantly losing my uncle(only father figure) and grandmother(only mother figure) not far from each other. Depression is an understatement of what I'm going through. I think that there is a reason for all of this but I just can't see it yet. My older sister has taken a disliking of me because I choose to miss the funeral of my uncle but I was across the country finishing school... I had to take a decision and I choose this one because no matter what I do I cant bring him back. I need professional advice. I cant afford therapy or a psychologist because of my financial situation but I want to hear how others coped with loss. And what I should do in this situation(the reason why I posted this is because lately I would overthink and think of suicide I know I should've and have never tried but it really scares me)|1
I feel excluded socially. Dating is a nightmare, and I feel like being my authentic self is not pleasing to anyone. Everyone claims to be so accepting, but they judge you if you act any different|1
I'm fucking terrified of what they'll do to me. all I hear is bad things about them pretty much.|1
just want to say it somewhere public instead of telling it to thin air every night. i wish it was either me or him alive, not both. i’ve had bad depression for over 10 years now. been through all kinds of abuse, all kinds of failures with myself or myself and others, absolutely nothing in my life has changed for the better since i was young. i’ve had addiction battles, attempted suicides, i’m a way worse person that i was last year and the year before and before. and not that im a bad person but i just don’t care about myself and i think i’m at an all time low for self care. i know all these words are just that - words. but life isn’t worth the small joyful moments, unless you’re lucky and get more than the rare ones. but not all of us are lucky. life isn’t fair, so if you’re lucky please do the rest of us who aren’t a favor and live it up.|1
"I have studied suicide methods for a long time and I know exactly how and where I would do it, it's very soothing to knowing that no matter what there is always Plan B.

Can't find a job? I'll just off myself.
Can't make friends? I'll just off myself.
Gonna go homeless? Well I can always just end it whenever I want.

I'm 19 but I feel like I've already lived enough, I dont have any ambitions or dreams for a future. I don't care about having a family, a decent career, a soulmate, none of that, my only desire is to sit alone in my room, running away from my problems like the coward I am.

The thought of moving on and getting my life back together is just as terrifying as the thought of not doing it. 

I'm stuck in a limbo of suffering and self sustaining misery, a neverending cycle of despair.

I know how to climb out of this grave I dug myself into, but I'm too scared to start."|1
i’ve been bullied to this stage. i wish i was good enough. i wish i wasn’t such a burden to everyone. i wish i wasn’t looked at like an object. i wish i wasn’t here. guys i don’t know what to do anymore.|1
I’m pissed, sad, and confused at the same time. I’m tired of being here and I have never been closer to ending everything. I’m not okay and I’ll never be okay. I keep getting worse. I need help.|1
"It’s been 7 years since I took cocaine. I never thought I was addicted, I just used socially and when my social circles moved away from it so did I. 
Lately everything has been going wrong but I’ve had to mask it, to be professional and eloquent, every fucking day. 
And all I want is cocaine. Not socially, just to get through the day."|1
"If you could fix one thing in your life, this one thing would in term significantly improve your life. What would it be?

For me, I have quite a few. I wished I asked that girl out when I was in college. I wished I had the courage to live life according to my own light, not living other's perceptions of what life should be. I wish I didn't keep telling myself that's it too late.

What would it be for you?"|1
I've been depressed since October, and had an eating disorder during the winter months (starving, binging cycle). Although it wasn't much of a binge, but just something to eat so I could go another day or two without food because not eating for a while causing stomach pain. But lately I've been having issues with constantly eating. Eating is the only thing that makes me happy. Of course food tastes good but it's more than that at this point. I feel like it's the only thing that can lift my mood. After that I just go back to sulking. I eat so much in a day it's a shock I haven't gained any weight. I can thank my fast metabolism for that. Nonetheless, it's unhealthy whether you can visibily see any weight gain/bodily changes or none at all. I know this is unhealthy but I wanted to know is anyone else like this? I don't think this is a Binge Eating Disorder, but it's definitely an unhealthy coping mechanism. I feel like I'm going overboard and I don't know what's wrong with me. I just eat for the serotonin boost, but it's always temporary.|1
My sister is 24, and I’m 16. She’s my best friend, but she has a really bad relationship with my mom, so does everyone in my family really. She was visiting us, and there was a huge freak out and she left. My dad pulled my hair and screamed and swore in my face, my sister got mad and shoved him, I don’t think my dad pulled my hair on purpose, but my sister was so mad that she left back to her house which is multiple states away. I feel so alone. I don’t want to be here anymore|1
This album is amazing to relate what is happening in the album “Hey You” always gives me strength to keep going with this fucking life don’t give up my friends, and it can always get worse work with what you’ve got and where you are I love you if anybody needs someone to talk to I’m available|1
"Rather than being in this state of “limbo” where I think about suicide maybe once or twice a week but ultimately don’t have the guts to do it for fear of wasting “potential” or what little hope I have left that things will turn for the better soon enough, and just wishing I didn’t exist or I would sleep without waking. 

Crush me hard enough that I see absolutely no hope or purpose in life anymore so I can have the “push” to really commit suicide. I hate being left seeing just the leaf of the carrot only for it to move away however much I try to get closer to it, while this depression ain’t going anywhere the whole time I’m chasing this carrot."|1
"I started fluxotine medication and I felt normal but it was only 10mg and I was supposed to go back after a month to review and increase and now all of a sudden I got 40% on a school quiz and now I’ve brought a knife to my room. I don’t know why I can never break my skin I just want to see myself bleed. I don’t want to be alive I’m useless can’t even pass stupid quizzes and I can’t even hurt myself or Jill myself.

How do I make it stop? Everyday I just don’t feel real. On the good days of medication I felt calm in a numb way but now I don’t even know I’m just scared"|1

"I have clinical depression and severe social anxiety and I've been going to a psychiatrist since a year and been on a ton of meds like wellbutrin , Lexapro , modafinil and others. None of them worked. Currently im on lithium and paroxetine for my depression and buspirone and clonazepam for my anxiety. My Suicidal thoughts have gone done considerably but not fully and I still feel hopeless and have literally no motivation throughout the day. I've been wanting to change my meds. Can u guys suggest me some antidepressants which helped you get ur motivation back and for the suicidal thoughts to stop?

"i know i probably shouldn’t be getting advice about this from reddit but i really don’t know where else to go. i understand that people on this subreddit are probably going through much worse things right now so i’m sorry but i think this is important. i’m not sure if i am depressed or not but i’d like to share my feelings with you guys and see if this is normal or if i need to get some help. i already go to therapy, i’ve been going for years and it’s not helping. i’m not on medication, but i might need to im not sure. i’ve done some research on what someone with depression looks like and this is what i found to relate to: 

- hopeless outlook
- lack of interest in anything and everything, including things i used to enjoy 
- increased fatigue (i usually don’t have sleep problems unless i’m anxious but even though i’m sleeping fine i feel exhausted every single day, i have no energy to do anything even when i eat and sleep properly) 
- anxiety 
- uncontrollable emotions
- looking at death (not seriously though, i think about it as an option for the future but i don’t believe that i’d actually go through with it. 
- symptoms interfere with work, social life and family. imm avoiding contact with my friends and family as much as possible which doesn’t make sense because they’re great people in my life who support me. 
- symptoms lasted for months
- continuous low mood or sadness
- low self-esteem
- feeling worthless/guilt ridden and feeling irritable and intolerant of others
- moving/speaking slower than usual
- self harm (it’s not extreme self harm, i just cut myself sometimes)
- no enjoyment out of life

while it sounds like these symptoms are bad, i don’t always feel terrible. sometimes i feel okay, but never good. i can’t remember the last time i felt happy, but i can remember the last time i felt fine. 

some of the symptoms i don’t deal with are these: 
- changes in appetite and weight
- constipation 
- lower sex drive
- changes to menstrual cycle
- sleep problems 

what i’m noticing for the most part is that i have all of the mental symptoms, but the physical symptoms haven’t been disrupted. i’m not sure if this means i don’t have depression but i’m afraid of telling my family or therapist because i have this idea in my head that they won’t believe me or think that i’m exaggerating or lying. i don’t know why i think that because they’re very supportive of my mental health, but they keep telling me that the way i feel is normal whenever i open up about my mental state and that i just need to go to therapy and wait for the summer holidays (because a lot of the stress i have is because of school). i’m missing a lot of school days because i felt like i couldn’t get out of bed and the way i’m behaving is effecting my relationships with family and friends to the point where i can’t even look them in the eyes a lot of the time. i’m worried they feel i’m just being lazy and unappreciative of the things they do for me. i think everyone is getting angry with me because of how i’m behaving and that’s one of the reasons why i’m posting this. sorry this is so long, but thank you to whoever has read this. i’m not sure what i should do."|1
"Hello everyone. I know a lot of us are struggling with depression. Often times, people with depression engage in self destructive behaviors that’ll make them feel good in the short term, but probably worse in the long term. Talking is always good even if it only relives the pain for 10 minutes. What’s yours? Mine are:

-Sleeping 
-Alcohol (probably the worse one I used to drink a pint of whiskey a day)
-Pointless sex
-Binge eating (Idk how I’m still skinny)

It’s tough giving advice to a depressed person, so I won’t bother. I know how a depressed mind works cause I have one. I hope we all get win the battles we’re facing. Nothing but peace and happiness."|1
"I'm suicidal. Nothing brings me joy. I can't sleep or eat. I get tired easily. I have paranoid thoughts. I have no energy. I take drugs and drink heavily to numb these feelings. I tried training, a job, a gf,college.. I failed, i tried but i failed.. So now im hopeless. What's the meaning of anything in this world. I have no desire in anything.i wanna off myself, i really do have balls to do it cause I already attempted once. My question is: which medication or habit/advice u have?

Even if one of u respond me I would be happy.
I really tried everything but no progress.
Medications:lexapro, paroksetin, wellbutrin, effexor, zyprexa. 
Any of you had success with something else.
Past few days were critical. If you want, any of you can dm me.
Thanks good people."|1
"It just reminds me how everyone is out doing nice things and I’m stuck in my cave pretty much dead to the world

I don’t know why I even try anymore"|1
I’ve started withdrawing from everyone, I deactivated my Instagram account a week ago, I’m not that active on social media anymore and I spend most of my time alone, it’s like I don’t exist anymore. I’m really concerned for myself because I’ve basically shut out the whole world. I shouldn’t be alive, I hope I die soon|1
"I don’t remember the last time I didn’t want to die. Every time I look out and see that the sun came up once again, it seems to almost not make a difference. I’m a walking corpse, a distorted being, I’m unsure of how to feel or live life. The only people I have in my life don’t know how to help, but at the same time they don’t want to try to understand. It seems that no matter how hard I try to keep a sense of joy in my mind, I can’t seem to recollect what it feels like. 

At my partner:
Every time I look at you I don’t seem to recognize who you are. As the time goes by you go neglectfully on your way, refusing to look at anything with emotion. I feel as if I am just a dog, a bitch, following you undeniably devoted to you, although as I look at you with love filled eyes... I do not seem to find any in yours except confusion and turmoil, but I continue to love you just the same because I don’t see the will to survive.

At my Youngest living sibling:
Every time I look at you I see how beautiful life is, and I protected you the best way I could. The world is cruel and I’m sorry that you’ve hard to watch me decline rapidly, I hope you know I’m trying my best for you, because I know you’ll always need me, and I’ll always need you.

At my pets:
I love you two. My life is easier to try because I know you need to eat like me and walk like me. I hope you understand even if we cannot communicate.

At my step mother:
Thank you for loving us from the start and treating us as if we were yours, because I wish we were. You’re the mom I wish I had earlier in life. You’re kind and you care about us.

At my dad:
I love you even after you’ve put me through an emotional and physical relationship with you. You were never there for me emotionally, and you always told me to suck it up ever after I had just been assaulted. You said that you hit me because you loved me, but I still don’t feel loved. You’re a new person now, a changed person, I’m glad for you, but now I’ll never get to heal. I’m sorry for all the things you had to go thru in your life, I hope that you get to heal. 
P.S. All I needed was a hug and an I’m sorry I could have done better.

At my mom:
You’re a fucking whore. I hate you. 
I treated you like, a daughter who loved her mother so grandly that she would die for her mother, and loved you with everything I had. I did whatever you asked of me and you took advantage without an ounce of remorse. You used me, and revealed secrets to me that I didn’t need to know. Why do you tell me you don’t love me but come crawling back when you need something. Alas I guess I should be happy since I am, now by your own dictation, in fact banned from your family. I can play games too, I can manipulate and disregard you as well, but instead I sit her and wallow in sadness and ideation. It would be a lie if I said I didn’t miss you, but now that you’re not my mom and I wish you were dead. 

To me:
I’m sorry that you can’t see who you are, and that you feel confused and unloved. I’m sorry that responsibility was too hard for the people who were supposed to love and protect you. I’m sorry that it feels like life is not worth trying and you want to give up so bad. 

To my friends:
I wish I could get better, but a lot of times I just don’t want to hangout. I’m sorry I was always a bummer.

This isn’t a death note."|1
I used to be a Mormon and in March I realized that there was no heaven and that when I die I'd be in a bleak realm of nothingness. I've gotten over it and accepted what would happen but I developed a hatred over others through my own mistakes and the reactions of people in my life. My passions are only seen by those close as an embarrassment or tool to them. I've gotten tired of them and I've been thinking that if I do die it wouldn't matter to them and if I hurt others it wouldn't matter to myself and those I've hurt since they'd be gone anyways. I know what I think is wrong towards others and I've hated myself over it.|1
"I don't consider myself a worthwhile person. I am on lesser disability due to a multitude of mental health problems, even as I am typing this my hands are shaky. I can't work or drive, I live with my dad at age 28 and overall, in many ways I am very much still like a child (Not immature, it is hard to explain) but I still try to help. I try to do things around the house. I make things like banners and signatures and renders for people online to use on my DeviantArt, never asking for money for it. I try to talk to others that are feeling down because I know how it feels and I try to help them feel passion for things, no matter how small those things are. I try to enjoy my passions, my life. Video games, media, and the little things in life. I love talking with others about what they enjoy, it makes me feel good. It reminds me of the things I enjoy.

Yet, every day is always watched over by the same thought; I sincerely wish I could end my life. All of the things above cannot stop that feeling. It always comes back by the end of the day and no day goes by without it creeping in. I always have reminders of my inferiority to others. I am always reminded that I have no future except one experiencing loss, watching friends and family grow distant or dying. My dad in particular is someone I worry about a lot. He is an idiot nowadays, he is a totally different person than in my childhood. He is narcissistic, he whines about the littlest of things and he doesn't do anything to help improve anything. Even so, he is still my dad and he has COPD, he refuses to quit smoking and I fear that anytime within the next few years it will take him to his grave. I guess this is one way of many how I am still mentally like a child in, if he dies, I don't know if I will be able to accept it. I don't want to go through that. I know everyone does, everyone has to, but I simply will break completely. I can't do it.

Beyond that, I have no other future. I can't work and I am so very bad at managing things in life. My mind is constantly all over the place. I often forget to do basic things, I am not good at all at managing finances or paperwork or anything like that. I can't keep track of it all. I know it sounds like I am useless, but I sincerely just can't manage things. It is why I don't live alone. My dad is the documented overseer of my finances as a result, though he lets me have it. So I am scared of the future, immensely. I am scared of everything. Being homeless, struggling to make ends meet, struggling to manage all that is expected as an """"adult"""". I see people going through each day, working 8 hours or more, managing paperwork and who knows what else and that is alien to me. I don't know how they do it. I have ""all the free time in the world"" and yet I can't even manage that properly. I just want to enjoy things in life, I want to be happy..but I live in constant fear of losing everything that I enjoy. I have extreme anxiety problems, I am autistic, I am bipolar depressive and I've had so many suicidal thoughts, but I fear death far too much to do anything. My childhood, those were the best days of my life. Not because being a kid is super easy or whatever, I simply could enjoy things back then. I had the same issues I have now, minus the depression, but I was able to just enjoy things, looking forward to playing a new game I got, being excited about a holiday, just having fun. I can barely do that now. I don't want to be useless to people so I try to justify my life, but I also want to enjoy the things I have. I feel like my life is on a ticking timebomb with an endpoint that is entirely random. Anything could ruin it all and I am so afraid of that.

People have constantly given me advice over the years. The usual blanket statements of ""do something about it"" or whatever. I simply don't know what I can do. I try to just enjoy my life for what it is and I can barely manage that. I always feel like I am running on borrowed time. Like a midlife crisis at age 28. I don't want to burden people...I am just me. I was born with hydrocephalus which is likely why my mental health is so bad. I rock back and forth constantly when sitting, I am always fidgety. I can't help that I am this way, but I don't want people to hate me. I do that enough to myself already.

I'm sorry if this is such a convoluted mess to read, I am simply trying to get things off my chest to calm myself down."|1
Everyday I’m just left to recurring fantasies about gearing up and going out like Swiss cheese...I figure if I’m gonna die anyway why not make a mark. Prove just how meaningless all of this is. I’m already dead, everybody is. It makes no difference when you die, the pain we feel. It’s all meaningless..haha but those are just thoughts ok mr fbi man :D|1
"I'm not sure if this belongs here but I've been struggling with depression and passive suicidal ideology for a long time now. I've been diagnosed and take medication for it as well as for other associated issues. I'm starting to grapple with the underlying problems of my depression and the most major thing I'm having trouble with is my self image and my sense of self worth. It's been difficult to conceptualize and articulate since I was a child, but now I can attempt to relay my thought process.

Since I was young I've only ever envisioned myself as a burden and an inconvenience. It always seemed to me that I was being tended to and taken care of because my mother was obligated. I always thought she didn't deserve to have to deal with me and that it would've been better if I hadn't have existed at all. Ceasing to exist would free her of her duty as a mother and she wouldn't be forced to be considerate of me any longer. I could imagine how much better her life could've been. 

Around the time I was eleven or twelve years old, I began to understand that as a young boy I had to exist in a world of competition. I realized that because I had nothing worth pursuing, I was left alone by my female classmates. They were spoiled for choice, no matter what I did there was no comparison between me and the boys they chose. I realized that without an obligation, I was never first choice. Or second, or third for that matter. I was always last. If nothing were a valid option, then it was preferable to choosing me. 

In the world of friendships I was only ever used for what I could provide and disposed of when I had served my purpose. What little I had came at my own expense. I was either the impliment of fear to deter would-be love interests for the female friends, or I was used similarly by my male classmates to deter bullies. There was a time when I was referred to as an ogre. I suppose it fits well; I'm tall, broad shouldered, mean looking, and was stronger than most people my age at the time. 

Ultimately, I feel like I'm a bother and an inconvenience most of the time. I'm tolerated until I'm discarded, but never preferred or appreciated. It seems like my existence is nothing worth sustaining. I entertain myself and I postpone the inevitable end to my exist purely because I'm hoping for something contrary to the rest of the examples of human interactions I've had thus far. I'm hanging on for the antithesis of my self image. I want it to be proven to me that I'm wrong in my assertions about myself. But maybe I'm putting all my worth and value in the opinions and decisions of others. It's hard for me to tell where I've made my mistake but it feels better when I'm alone and don't have to bother with other people. It's almost like other people remind me of how horrible and inconvenient I am.

I suppose the question here should be stated clearly instead of inferred. I don't know how to undo this way of looking at myself. I was hoping someone on this subreddit could help me understand the process of undoing how I've conditioned myself into this world view."|1
I used to be a member of this subreddit and I’ve had my own struggles and battles before. But right now an old girlfriend of mine has come to me while she’s been on a cross country trek around the US and texted me telling me she’s never felt more suicidal than she does now. I texted back and told her I’m here for her and I’m sorry she feels that way. And I am. She’s my ex. Doesn’t mean I don’t care for her very deeply. She’s on the other side of the country from me right now and I can’t come to her otherwise I would. But she shut down almost immediately after texting me and I’m sitting on my front porch writing this post because she won’t talk to me and I don’t know what to do. She keeps telling me she’s okay and fine when I know she isn’t. I try to tell her how much I care and how much I truly hope she feels okay. I want her to know how important that is to me. I don’t know what I’d do in the world without her. I’m crushed that she’s feeling suicidal. A lot of it stems from men and her own feelings of insecurity about how she looks. I can’t tell her that she’s beautiful and there’s nothing wrong with her because she won’t believe me. I’m at a complete loss. I don’t know what to say. I don’t know how to make it better. I need help. I need to know how I should talk to her. She’s very important to me. She means too much to me to let here be down in the dumps like this. I want to help. I just don’t know how.|1
"Just wanted to share my frustrations from the past few days.     

&#x200B;

My contract is expiring so I need to find a new job (desperately, I'l the sole wage earner, and sole insurance provider for my family.   which is a whole other thing) .....

&#x200B;

I spend the day getting myself as energized as possible for these interviews (which is exhausting) and I feel like I have a decent shot each time.

&#x200B;

then 3:00-4:00 rolls around, and the ""I'm sorry but we're moving on town other candidates"" start rolling in.   I'd be weeping at my desk if the Wellbutrin didn't make that all but impossible (instead it just hurts by face and chest).

&#x200B;

I had a friend check out just over a year ago during his search just over a year ago.     I get it, I get it."|1
Hahaha, not me thinking that if I kill myself today, I won't have to worry about my assignment that's due tonight. If I kill myself today, I won't have to study this weekend for my test on Monday that I'm totally unprepared for. If I kill myself today, I won't have to go to work on Monday. Most importantly, if I kill myself today, I won't feel worried and overwhelmed anymore|1
Mentally I killer myself last month, my body is still here. It’s in pain and my mind is wants to leave but I’m trapped- a zombie stumbling by coping with nothing but alcohol.|1
"Today I cleared months of empty medication packets and their empty sheets from my bed head. I take 3 medications daily and have a storage style bed head. It takes me ages to find the current sheets with medication still in them. 
And I finally cleaned it.

Small steps. ❤️"|1
I hate my job (retail no degree) and I'm going to college to try and get a better job. I going for an art degree but I don't know if I can wait that long. I hate this job and any other job on indeed I see just makes me want to tear my hair out. Idk whats wrong with me and I feel like I haven't had a break. I feel like I am about to have a breakdown, like a massive one. I can barely work the hours I need to and I'm always tired and drained. I upped my hours but I feel like thats about to cause a breakdown and I don't know how long I can hold on. I just wish I was normal and my head hurts so much. I just wish the pain would stop. There's always this mental pain and tension in my head, I can't do this anymore. I want out, I just want to find something that doesn't make me want to sleep for a thousand years. I want to feel like I'm doing something useful with my life. I'm going to talk to my therapist later and ask if I can get a letter or something to take a break at work and then change my hours back. I can't handle this and I hate that its something so small like this that causes me to feel this way. It makes me feel lazy and I know thats not the case because this illness is not my fault and I'm trying but I just look lazy to people who don't have to deal with this and I hate it. I wish I could leave this planet. I want to float out in the abyss not having to deal with feeling anymore|1
"no matter how many antidepressants i get bumped to, i still dont feel happy. just numb.
i lie on the internet, i lie in real life
i tried to kms, but i didnt want my dog sad
im afraid of talking to my family because every time i try to fit in they push me out
i cant handle the stupidity of people at my school, but i fear that im too stupid to realise i am too

my mum was a smoker and her nails yellowed, and it scares me that i might be like her"|1
"I’m already late to get up but it’s okay, no one is waiting for me on campus, or anywhere really. 

I’m cycling through the same wants again, friends, couch, comfort, time, travel.

I’m tired of yearning. 

It’s like the force that drives me to try new things, take risks, have a little hope, has died. Keeping myself alive is exhausting."|1
I’m surprised I’ve held out for this long. I hate basically everything about myself and it doesn’t seem like there’s a point to existing when I’m so miserable anyway. I need to start working out and I need to clean and I need to get gas and go to the bank and do laundry and start eating healthy and figure out what I want to do with my life. I need to fix the schedules for my jobs. They’re a mess. I need time for exercise and hobbies. I don’t want to be here anymore. I’m not excited for anything.|1
I have adhd and its super hard to focus sometimes. Sometimes I just can't work and then I'll stay up till 6 feeling lost, worthless and feel like I'm wasting my life. Then cry myself to sleep than wake up at 12 and repeat the cycle. Anyone else got adhd or any other cocktails|1
"Around the age 11 my mom started a relationship that turned real toxic and abusive. While I was sleeping one day they gotten into a fight which led to getting hit by an iron. I remembering waking up confused in the middle of the night by a bunch of my neighbors and later going back to my bed a couple of hours later. My mom later woke me up that morning with her head wrapped around bandages and walking me to my bus stop. It felt like everyone knew what happened to my mom at the time but me and I was scared. That experience was just the start of the relationship as they continued the relationship until I was 18. They were many times where ill try to protect my mom in fear of her getting hit again but there were also days I wasn't there to protect her which led to her having bruises on her face. They even got married at one point which broke me and they had my brother who I love. 

During the Abusive relationship I started slowly becoming numb to everything but had friends who I didn't tell what was happening to me but provide me support and something to look forward too everyday. School was like the only place I wanted to stay at or literally do anything else with friends but going home since it was too painful to go back home. My friend  were always there for me even when they don't know my situation and would care more for them then myself.

When I turned 18 they separated and things got better overall but my mental health is not doing so well. I believe my mental health was in a better spot during the relationship. There are many days I would just sleep majority of the days cause I was depressed or If my mom yelled at me for little things I would mentally breakdown in my room without know one knowing. I refuse to get mad because i fear that if I do get mad something abusive would happened or I would be abusive just like my mom's ex which breaks me mentally. 

COVID happened and now I feel like I automatically feel like put up a persona  in front of other people enough where it doesn't look like I'm suffering,  but in reality I am drowning in darkness. Family thinks I am the one to end the bad cycle of mental health in the family and going to graduate college but now have no motivation for anything in my life or know what to do even if I dropout of college. I would like to talk to like a therapist or family, friends to help me but my mom is going through trauma problems of her own and I cant see her sad like that If she found out. 

I had never thought about self-harming myself and never had but, I know these things are just trauma and depression taking effect but it feels very hard to escape the mental breakdowns even though I'm nothing like my mom's ex or me not being to do anything motivating and just be easier to sleep through it. These things used to happen not so often but feels like it is happening almost couple days a week now."|1
Does anyone ever feel better after watching a Superhero movie or reading a comic, especially when it involves superheroes dealing with mental health struggles? Like Daredevil w/ depression, Scarlet Witch w/ depression/ptsd, Batman w/ ptsd/depression/adhd?|1

"Y’all I am really starting to struggle. I took up a summer job on a resort that is in the mountains. Literally in the woods. I’m from a college town in Northern California and this job is about a little over an hour from my town. I’m housed in a cabin with other employees and then on my weekends live in my hometown. This is just for summer. 

I was really excited for this change. I have never been on my own before and I also just turned 21 this month so I’m trying to have fun and live life more ya know. Ive had a lot of traumatic things happen the last couple years and I’m really trying to grow from these negative things. 

I’m just. Really starting to struggle. Coworkers come to our cabin and it’s never “where is (me)?” Or “(me) come hang”

The first day was but now I just feel so pushed out. I just feel so alone. Like no one wants me. I am trying to include myself cause I am actually a very loud, outgoing person and people love that about me but, if they love that why do I never feel wanted to be around. 

Why do I feel like a constant bother? It’s like everyone has someone to talk to...but me. I am always the one left out...unless I make the plans. 

I really hate this feeling."|1
I can’t do anything right. I’m always so tired and lazy and never motivated. I push those around me away. I can’t do it.|1
I'm not doing very well. Like, really not doing too well. I dreamed about my ex last night. It's been 5 years, but I still dream about her. And in all those dreams, she rejects me again. How am I supposed to get over her and get better when my own subconscious is sabotaging me?|1
"Now or never, I need to finally put my own feelings into words while the cheep bear is encouraging me to press the post button. If you're a psychologist  or you have the knowledge of one idrk, an shoulder to lean on is all i need  


I don't know when it all started, most probably it slowly snowballed since I the first day of kindergarten. I remember myself being as a shy kid, always anxious after laugh at and trust me, there were enough times, but hey, that's child mentality. Anyways, my early childhood made me gravitate around being the quiet kid and the problematic one. Trough all and all I remember myself having a thin skin, either getting along with everyone or isolating myself for my own good, though i didn't really understood the reason why at the time. Up in the middle school things didn't got any better, hanged around the wrong crowd, picking up vices that I now regret only to fit in, the picking becoming bullying just because I was an easy target. Idk why or exactly what but something made me feel like I didn't fit with everybody else, even trough this day when I look back I feel like i was differently wired in my noggin. The picking became bullying, and I remember the Sundays that i would take off to recharge my batteries would become summers but all in all i craved company, and I would be back around the same rough crowd. In high school things had gotten worse, some guys that I didn't personally knew but they would knew me trough one of my bullies would terrorize me, with brass knuckles, tasers and dead rats, a few times i would've been kicked in the back. Imagine my face when I finally told my sister and we went to the principal. You could imagine how things went out, his classmates would takes his side and my anxious ass would be lost of words. One day I couldn't take it, and stepped in the first car I seen driving by. It grazed my face, put me in the hospital for about a week. You could imagine how bad i felt for placing my family in a financial dent because of my hospitalization. Things slowly went downhill but luckily I was smart enough to change schools, Things slowly started to get better, a few up and downs but i think somewhere around the sophomore and junior high school my depression would start to kick in, I would start to lose sleep, skip meals and daydrink, you can only imagine what that did to my overall mental health and weight. I would start to finally integrate with everyone else in the last two years of highschool, make a new best friend but christ am i a bad judge of character. That guy would only think with his dick, as soon as he would set his eyes on a girl he wouldn't know anything of friends, brothers or anything, sometimes he would toss people under the buss to get attention, god I can't believe I saved him from beatings, or that I found him attractive. But yeah, After my 19th birthday me and him went to a rock festival and he was the one who made me fed up with everything. After I graduated high school I cut all the connections I would had wit the outside world and spend that summer by myself, again. Not everything was bad in high school though, I met a few girls, some weren't so good, I'll be honest I was and maybe am still a bit imature too but the other two? They were the reason I kept living, the reasons I kept striving for love.               One was a brazilian, gorgeous, nerdy, nutty and crazy enough to find me appealing for who I really am. The other one was a bengali girl, sweet, caring, loving hell, I loved her to bits, I still do, I only hope for the best for her and her sister, she was the reason why I went in the trade school for nursing, to give her a life and get her out of there asap, but she broke my hearth and lied to me in order to do that. Long story short  I  feel in a depressive episode. My performance at school dropped significantly.   


To say something about the trade school I was in? It wasn't like the other renown nurse schools, or even the college, so naturally there was a pecking order in the hospitals. That would result in nurses ignoring us if you wouldn't have connections or a nurse that would take pity on you resulting in spending hours laying against the walls hopping for any task. Why I kept hanging in? IDK hopping that it would get better the next year. But imagine the shame I would feel when a nurse would ask me what could I do and I would say nothing. The 3rd year was the year there was a change in the administration and the year most teachers would quit. I only lasted a semester longer.  


Around December 2019 and January 2020 I had a pretty rough episode. I can't remember my anxiety acting so bad. But starting that year I couldn't take it anymore and dropped off school. I told my mother and one of my brothers about that, I couldn't look the others in the eyes and tell that i dropped after all the effort, hell I didn't had the courage to tell my sister till this month.  


Anyways, things slowly turned better, I would had some odd jobs here and there, met an amazing woman the year prior almost got over my depression but, all nice things always come to an end.  Let me tell you something, that woman? She's nutty, but I do love her like the world, she remind me of the brazilian one in a lot of regards, she found me attractive, funny, worth while, a friend, hinted possibly as a lover if we were in the same continent but she find someone after all and just like the first one she poofed out of the internet. I was destroyed, I still ache for both of them to this day but I learned to let go for better or worse.  


As for my professional life? My educational system run with the french bacalaureate, it's basically a diploma you take an exam for after high school, aaaand i still don't have it. I tried, some summers I just gave up and I ultimately grit my teeth and got a job as much as I dislike people. it's a night job at a courier company basically moving boxes and let me tell you something, if being belittled for being slow doesn't break you and if your back doesn't break during the cold winter nights then its the night after night for minimal wage that breaks you. For the last 6 months I felt exhausted, less of a man, broken from ligament to ligament for a sense of exaggeration. I's a throat cutting business, in the sense that everyone tried to drag you down and the fool that I am for admitting my mistake, hell I filled my resignment this month and my boss was looking for someone to put at fault for that. I want to take the summer for myself like always, at first I tried to ask for a rest vacation and i was told no. I still want to be financially independent, get that damn diploma so i wouldn't have to work minimum wage and be able to find a career in programing and hopefully leave my country.  


The last but most important my family. They're not perfect, no family is I realize that, and between the many people that I met I have it much better than some. They are loving caring and supportive the best way they know how, but I could never came out with my depression to anyone, for the fear of not being understood, of being told that im just shy or anything that they can rationalize my struggle. for the almost 23 years of my life i can remember days and days of domestic disputes, I was almost never hit, except for rare exceptions but those ended short but the yelling matches? I ended up buying noise cancelation headphones to bare with them. I come from a post communist country so you can imagine that everyone a decade older than me is a hard working person and moved out before 18. With that comparison and with my brother's happy family I feel like nothing, I feel like I wasted my life before it even started, I feel like a burden and I don't know if I have the strength or will to keep pushing on, I don't even feel like a part of this broken system.  


I'm sorry if it's too long or if its all over the place or even if it's not fitting for this sub but these are my thoughts, the rod i walked in my shoes and i felt the need to let my story known and vent"|1
"I'm in the process of getting a new job and I wanted to do 24 hours a week while I'm taking summer college courses. The head manager kept pushing 4 8 hour shifts on me where I would work every single thursday-sunday (assignments are always due on sundays) during the summer. I also dont think I'm allowed to ask for any time off for the first either 3 or 6 months off. I need just 3 days off the summer but my manager didn't accept that I wanted 4 6 hour shifts, he wanted me to work 32+ hours doing manual labor and just never acknowledged what I wanted. I will get paid 16 an hour and I can't refuse that.

My friends had a coworker that was lonely and so they wanted me to meet him. They didn't have any of my interests in mind (they thought we were perfect since we are both nerds and play the same video game, that's it). He was basically the exact opposite of my type and my friend said I couldn't talk about being lonely since im picky and didn't like that guy. She shut me down completely and dismissed me as she usually does. She is overweight and talks about losing weight and calories all the time and she knows I have anorexia (relapsed 2 weeks ago) and if I ever bring up how I feel about my weight she'll say ""your skinny, I'd kill to be your size"" and then she'll go right back to talking about restricting calories.

The guy I dated for 4ish months? We stopped seeing each other and a month or so later... Well he waited till I got drunk the first time when I was 19 (he was 25) and that's when he got all handsy and I was afraid to say no because now I realize he constantly gaslit me. He kept moving next to me and putting his hand on my back and I was constantly trying to get away and say stop. He asked to sleep with me later that night and I said no. He never did anything else after that but... I went to bed thinking he wasn't gonna listen to me again and went to sleep thinking he was gonna come into the room I was in (vacation with friends at a house) and do whatever he wanted. I texted him once I was safe and at home after we all got back and he told me how it was all my fault and I wasn't clear enough that I didn't like him (we stopped seeing each other 2 months before and he admitted earlier that he knew I didn't feel much of anything for him anymore). He gaslit me all over again.

Emotionally abusive dad - he is always right and im wrong (too much to say) 

My old roommates would get upset with each other all the time and would use me as the middleman. That may have been an argument but it may also have involved money. Both of them refused to make a payment? Well someone has to do it. Both of them argue over returning the router? Well you have to do it (I moved I'm way after them and had nothing to do with internet service other than paying my monthly part). Both of them said they would return it but once they fought? All of a sudden it's on me.

One of my new housemates asked to take my room  permanently since the other girl hadn't moved out of the room she was gonna be in. I just felt like I had to give it to her and I couldn't just say no. She got the hint and was totally chill about it but I realized how scared I am to speak up about what I need or want because I always get dismissed or people get upset with me. I felt such a high after the girl said it was no issue because no one acknowledges me like that. We barely know each other yet but she didn't walk all over me and that was just something I havent felt in so long.

I just want people to realize that I have feelings too... it's so depressing to just be everyone's supporting character who has no life of their own. I'm not here for you to work every weekend to death, use for sex or a relationship, use as a friend, use for something I have. I just don't know how to find healthy relationships with anyone. I just want someone to value me as a person and understand that I can't comply to every request just because I'm seen as nice or a people pleaser. I dont want people to get upset when I say no or dismiss me. Is it too much to ask to at least get the chance to be happy or have a say in what I want in life?"|1
"Does anyone else have this?

I feel so trapped. It’s so hard to explain—being super depressed on meds that do work most of the time but not fully. It’s weird.

I cut myself the other night. I’m a 30 year-old disabled man.

I’m miserable help me"|1
right now i really only have one reason to live, and that’s my friends. i have a jerk brother with a bad temper, i’m barely passing my high school classes, and i have basically no talents. i have depression, some days i eat one small meal a day because i just can’t bring myself to eat. i either need some reasons to live to help me out of this mood, or the most painless method of suicide. please help me.|1
"I am basically unable to focus on anything. Doesn't really matter what, (studying, creative writing, whatever,) I just can't stop my mind from endlessly going around in circles about literally anything else other than what I'm doing.

*(For reference, I've been diagnosed with ASD and anxiety, and definitely have moderate-severe depression - yet working on getting that diagnosed soon. Also at the moment I'm luckily going through a phase where my depression has let up a lot, so I'm trying to form habits and get on top of things again before the next wave hits.)*

Anyway, even if I'm not in a depressive state, I just can't sit down and do anything because my head just won't shut up. For example; I'll be studying Japanese and then suddenly my brain goes *'but what if we begin to outline that story idea that's been in your head for a week?'* and I say to myself *'no, shut up we are doing Japanese now.'* Then my brain goes on a whole spiel about the story idea and planning out scenes I could write and then literally starts writing a whole chapter in my brain. Suddenly, I can't focus on my Japanese that I've been putting off for a while, so I finally decide to indulge myself.

About 5 minutes in, my brain starts up again. *'Remember how you were meant to research Ancient China since you missed a few of your history classes the past week? You should do that now',* so I try to argue with myself for about a minute before all the tabs I have open for creative writing are now switched to various educational websites on Ancient China.

Then, surprise surprise, my brain goes, *'hey... want to go back to Japanese now?'*

&#x200B;

It's so annoying, and yet I just can't fight it otherwise my head just stuck in a complete loop of doing things. I've tried taking a break from doing work when this happens, yet either my brain still won't stop or I'll lose any motivation to do anything but sleep. I've tried just powering on, but my brain just won't shut up. I've tried just doing whatever I feel like, but the constant changing of topics means I just can't get into the flow of things and at the end of my little spark of motivation, I've done barely anything..

I want and *need* to focus on one thing at a time. It's not really like I'm restless or need to get out of my chair, or other outside noises just distract me as it would be with someone with ADHD/ADD. It's seriously just my brain, and it's constant, distracting monologue of *other things I could be doing,* or *this is too hard, maybe change to another, easier topic,* and little sprits of *you can do this later, do that one other far less important thing first so in 5-10 minutes I can change it on you again.* 

&#x200B;

And if I am in the middle of a depressive episode, it's far worse. Half the time I don't even get my brain never shutting up, it's more kind of silent murmuring until I go to do something and suddenly it's a bunch of excuses of why I shouldn't do that, or why I can't do this, and it absolutely kills any motivation I've built up. The other half of the time my brain is just numb, with a fog around it, stopping all motivation and concentration until I feel like crap and just want to go to sleep.

So I just need to improve my focus/concentration and initial (and keeping up motivation, as I lose that pretty quickly after starting something). I honestly just don't know how.

&#x200B;

Anyway, if someone has advice on any of this (apart from a simple ""Just practise mindfulness"" as I have absolutely *zero clues* as to how I'd *specifically* go about that, lol).

Have a lovely day you guys! <3 <3

&#x200B;

*(PS; sorry for the long post, my brain made me write this instead of studying Japanese like I was meant to, so... oops, lol.)*"|1
Which artists make music similar to the $uicideboy$?|1
I feel like crying, haven't been able to in years. I wish I could throw up right now, I feel ill, but I'm not. I lay in bed all day and have no interest in my hobbies. I really wish I could throw up. I don't have anyone I can trust, I haven't spoken to my family in almost a year. I really want to be left alone, but know I won't feel better.|1
"I don't think this is in violation of community guidelines, I really am curious about anyone else's journey of natural treatment of depression vs. Psychotropic treatment. 

I (36m) have recently transitioned from using psych meds, to using low doses of a thc&CBD tincture(5mg x 4times daily) for about 2 weeks now. I'm not sure of how I'm really reacting to it as this has corresponded with me also fighting COVID through the same period. Has anyone else made this transition, and if so what was it like, and has it worked for you long term?"|1
Just wanted to say love you all!|1
i have a bottle of 50mg pills that i take randomly when i want to sleep better, most i've taken at a time being 200mg. i'm wondering how much others have taken and how it's affected them. i don't want to exist today, so i'm planning to take a high dose and dissolve into my bed for the next 24 hours|1
u guys ever get the urge to just completely destroy everything around, i want to be addicted, i want to have no friends or family, i want to be someone that disgusts people by just existing, i want to drop out of school, idek why i have these urges but i dont want my life together (not like it is now)|1
That’s all I ever needed in life, I’m tired of always feeling unwanted.|1
"This evening, I realised that can no longer enjoy an orchestral concert. 

Even as I listen to and appreciate the music, I am harangued by a constant monologue of self-hatred. I could never be so skilled, I could never contribute something so beautiful to the world, I am useless, I have nothing to offer, I am failing, I wish I were that clarinettist, I wish I were anyone but myself... The cycle goes on.

Yet simultaneously I am disgusted by this side of myself. How could I be so appallingly self-centred?

I just wish that I had something to give to the world, something like the cellist's rich, dark beauty. And I wish that I could enjoy books, music, artworks, scientific endeavours, and eloquence without being so caught up with self-hatred. It's exhausting and upsetting.

It also seems quite dangerous that these things which bring me joy are slowly being sapped by my own thoughts. I do not want to have to avoid concerts.

I wish I were anyone else."|1
"It may be false optimism, but I finally left my hometown and for the first time I'm starting to get excited for my future.

I don't know when it really started. It feels so old that i think I've always been like this. The thought of killing myself gets stronger everyday. My mind is making sure the world would be a better place without my presence. I see my mother crying over me, worrying about me, making my depression personal and think she is the reason why i am like this. I hate to see her cry, i hate to see pity in her eyes. Looking at me like I have something that is not curable, a plague. I've disappointed myself, my loved ones, but mostly myself. Can it be over? Without me being dead? Will i ever be normal? I made this happen. İ just despise myself. Some people are destined to be doctors, some people lawyers, maybe I'm destined to commit suicide and die. Maybe that's my destiny...|1
So I have a post on my profile about a button, if you haven't read it or can't find it, it's basically a counter of how many people have left me, like people I wanted a relationship with, I'm on 9.9, when I get to 10 I die. I'm so close just pressing it, Even though no one has left me I'm fed up of suffering, each day is painful seeing other people in relationships yet I can't get one, I'm 17 and I can't imagine getting to 18, the counter has been around since December whilst I have been suicidal for a year and a half. I just want the pain to stop and I'm dead set on the counter, been to multiple therapists and they couldn't do anything, I knew from the beginning as they can't help with a relationship. So Im not really talking to anyone but I just want that last person to either stay with me or push me over, I'm happy either way. I tell people online but they can't do anything, they are either too far away or too old and it makes me feel like a burden as they get stressed knowing what's going on...|1

I'm starting to wonder if my heavy drug use as a teenager has messed up my mind I've felt this way for a long time like 20 years I feel like life is just fake almost like an experiment on human beings and none of this shit is real and I can see the fabrications and it gives me anxiety and also why I can't sleep without pills .I also use to be an avid church goer but I felt like it was all a scam . Have I lost my mind or just depressed and over think everything.|1
I’ve been helping my mom because I’ve been planning on dying soon. So for the past year I’ve done everything I could to help. Now I’m gonna move n wait about 6 months until I do it. I don’t want anyone to know so imma move away from everyone I know n isolate so they forget me. Hopefully the family will show up to the funeral. I hope they do I’ve missed them|1
"Why am I like this? 

Okay so I’ve been having horrible luck with relationships. For almost 2 years I’ve been rejected, toyed with and abandoned used by half-a-dozen people and I kinda tired of it. The few times I actually been able to feel close with someone they end up hurting me and it just makes everything harder. 

Through all of it I’m just starting to think that it’s all my fault. Like I try to take something out of what wannabe shitty relationships and I try to learn. And I can say that a few of these people (although while they couldn’t have cared) have helped me be a better person. 

But, at the same time it’s made me finicky around people (I say people as I may be Pan, but that’s not the point) like I feel that everything I do is going to do could trigger some trauma that I didn’t know about, or someone I have a crush on gets hurt. I know this makes things difficult but I can’t seem to break this habit. It’s given me a lot of trust issues ig and Idk what to do.

In the end I kinda think my depression just gets in the way. For example: the ONE stable relationship I’ve had in my life was ruined my a combination of covid-induced depression and a serious family issues, led to me and my then-partner breaking up. Now I got distant and didn’t talk to her for weeks but my partner knew about my problems yet made not effort to check up on me. I don’t hold this against her cus she wasn’t really exposed to many people with serious mental health problems and it makes me feel like that my depression (while a helpful  Conscience lmao) makes me a freak, unable to function intimately with anyone. It makes me feel like I don’t deserved to be loved cus I’ll just hurt someone.

I don’t wanna play a victim or anything obviously but I just want help to figure out how to beat this. I just want to be comfortable with opening myself up to people. 

Sorry I’m rambling I saw my previously mentioned ex really happy at prom a few weeks back and I am the only single guy in my friend groups :( 
So to see everyone else so happy around me it just hurts cus I want some of that you know?"|1
sometimes it feels like i can physically feel the hole inside of me. i can feel that something is missing. i can feel an empty hole in my chest. the drive, the passion, the confidence, the simple will to live, that i am missing is supposed to fill that hole. the hole has become so big i feel overwhelmingly empty if i begin to think about my life. i can feel the emptiness inside of me i feel it tearing apart my chest the hole becoming bigger. it doesn’t hurt just feels so empty|1
"My brother was just diagnosed with cancer. It’s pretty bad in the late stages. He is quite young and honestly just starting his life. It makes me really sad that he has cancer because he is so enthusiastic about life and what he wants to do. I wish I was the one with cancer and not him. I wake up every morning ungrateful for being alive and wishing I weren’t, when he’s over there wishing he had longer to live.  

I’ve spent the last decade trying to enjoy life. Going to therapy and trying all the things they say but I just don’t think life is for me. I wish I could transfer my years to him."|1
I don't understand the point to human existence , just working and buying stuff paying taxes eating food .I don't think humans were meant to live like this and that's why everyone is so depressed all the time .|1

Also, I meant incel in the most literal sense, not the way you’re probably thinking of."|1
"for the past few years i’ve told all my friends that dating is unnecessary and having a person is overrated, but in reality having someone feels amazing. 

this all started in middle school. (i know, we were children at the age of 12 but) the memory will always stay with me. i went to a school from preschool-eighth where the class size was thirty kids. for twelve years i grew up with the same kids. i had a crush on this one boy for about five years and when i finally told him at a beach party to celebrate the end of the school year, he told me he had a crush on my best friend who is still my best friend to this day. that’s fine. younger me brushed it off and started crushing on another boy for the last three years of middle school. a group of kids in the grade turned it into a joke that the fat girl had a crush on the star soccer player. and then he asked my friend out in front of me. needless to say, middle school me didn’t have a lot of luck.

then came high school. i had a crush on this boy i sat next to in biology, i didn’t have the courage to say anything and he ended up dating someone sophomore year for the next seven years. he’s still a good friend of mine and i’ll always have a special place in my heart for him because i already know i’d be reaching if i were to ever go for it again. the next guy i had a crush on told all his friends on the football team and they spread rumors in our grade through an anonymous messaging app. i remember one of the things that was posted as if i were saying that was “man if ___ lowered his standards maybe i might have a chance”.  i spent the rest of senior year hanging out with my close friends and avoided talking to anyone outside of my group. i swore off dating/crushes till college after that. 

in college, i befriended a group of guys from my church and developed feelings for one of the guys. he was out of my league but he talked to me as if i were just any other person. he didn’t ever mention how i looked or what i ate, i felt normal. and then the group kicked me out after the oldest member of the group said he had to pick between the group and me. you could guess what he picked. after that it’s been constant rejections and being politely told that i’m not their type when it comes to dating. at this point i think i’ve just accepted that getting my feelings hurt isn’t worth it and that i should just accept being the cool friend but not to date role. when my friend’s talk about low self esteem, I think mine is sub zero. i’d like to hope that one day my feelings will be reciprocated but i doubt it. that’s about it. just wanted to talk to a void since everyone i know keeps telling me it’ll get better. i’ve been telling myself that for the past 22 years and it hasn’t."|1
Anyone else get this way? It just makes me want to never be in a relationship and avoid people.|1
"In my freetime all I do is sleep or daydream. Literally. Because nothing feels better than getting lost in my head, or being unconscious. I'm literally wasting all my days, weeks are going by in a flash because I keep sleeping like 12-15 hours a day. And I can't stop. Whenever I try to at least motivate myself to do SOMETHING like play a video game, watch a movie, go for a walk, I always think ""Nah, I'd rather just sleep."" I'm addicted to sleeping. Is anyone else like this?"|1
"Basically I was told by a shaman about my future. For those of you who don't believe in such things, might as well open up a lil bit. I was also skeptical, didn't believe in those powers, but they proved that to me. They have read my mind. I thought about something only I can think about, and they have GUESSED THAT. So anyways, I was mystified etc. Now let's go back to the prediction.

He said that I'm going to be even more self-hating and would become a... criminal in the future and that I'm going to end up in jail.

At the same time he also talked about free-will etc., but this thing keeps me bothering so much, I wanted to hang myself, but I know I can't to that.

He also laughs at my stupidity and I just can't stand it. I know I am dumb but please just let the dumb person be happy. I kinda hate myself even more.

I know I used to make fun of egocentric people myself, I was never prone to depression, but damn isn't it the worst thing you can say to a self-hating perosn???????????

don't get me wrong, I'm not delinquent or anything yet, but denying your dark side is probably also stupid. I hate that person and sometimes I fantasize about beating them.

I want to change my ways, but he said that I'm going to end up as a negative person and it's just feels so bad. i know it's vanity, everyone wants to be told they are good while they are not, but honestly, I want to die. Like I feel hopeless, despair , I don't know what I am, like I am facing the unknown dark abyss...

i'll be more than happy if I suicided, but I feel so sorry for my parents and siblings... I never told them about that... I know they re not going to understand me, NO ONE UNDERSTANDS ME! I'm fucking done."|1
"My grandmother is very mean and has stage 4 cancer i'm the only one that has been here for her, ONLY. I have lied for her so many times. She steals my moms pills, she has an attitude 24/7. Every day my mom and family would kick her out I would be the one to get her back in. I came to this stupid hotel so I can spend time with her and it has been terrible. She just had an attitude cause I asked for her keys so I can put her stuff in her car, ""no no no bring my stuff up here why do you want my keys"" I tell her why and still attitude attitude attitude. She has so much stuff because she's basically living at hotels my mom is paying for and I have packed and unpacked and brought up her bags 5 times! 5 fucking times. I've did nothing but help her and she still is so mean. Im the only fucking one who cares about her and she treats me like shit. If you're thinking shes just like this because of the cancer your wrong she has always been."|1
People at least show some concern towards me|1
I have very few things to be depressed about. I have a job, a girlfriend, decent grades, etc. Yet no matter how much i achieve things or buy stuff i still feel terrible. At least once per day I have this terrible feeling wash over me and i cant figure out why. Sometimes i can push it out of my mind and sometimes i cant. I’m posting this here because i would assume this is some sort of depressive disorder but i honestly have no idea. How can i make this stop? I  just want to be happy.|1
"I’m stuck in a very bad spot I’ve seen so much stuff I don’t even want to be alive I really need a friend to talk to someone who actually cares not just to boost their ego what I mean is someone who wants to talk not wants to not be that person who didn’t talk someone out of killing them selves 

Please just anyone I’m only 17 and I just want everyone dead so that way when I die no else gets hurt because their all dead 
Makes sense ? 

I really need a friend to talk to In person or at least online 

Life is so precious I really don’t want to waste my chance at life being miserable and scared"|1
"I don't know how to introduce myself properly. All I know is that I am hopeless and so depressed. I moved from my home country last year to come and live in France since I am enrolled in a french engineering school.   
 While I don't really know how to come up with a proper psychological diagnosis, I think that I have been suffering for a long time from depression.  
 Since an early age I was brought up in a really caring and loving family that would do anything for me and despite the fact that I have always done relatively well in school and was always among the top tier students, once I started growing up, my life has been nothing but a big void: a constant search for identity and a deep feeling of despair.  
 I don't even know how to express what I am feeling, but I decided to post this hoping that someone would actually share his/her experience with me.  
 I am a borderline introvert (to put it mildly: I hate over-stimulation) and I don't really have friends especially since I came to France and even before that I only had few (true) friends. And even when  I am around people, I constantly feel alone and I avoid speaking about what I really feel deep inside because people already have enough struggles. It is not like I am the only one struggling out there.   
 Besides, speaking about deep topics might pull people down and put them in a gloom state and for that I always keep my stories to myself.  
 Before coming to France, I was hoping to go to the United States and enroll in an Ivy League and live the american dream but guess what: ' I failed!'.  I ended in a very good engineering school in France.  I did fairly well in the first semester and ranked second amongst the students of my promotion but I still feel that void inside me.  
 At first, I thought that it might probably be a sign that I should apply another time to the US but later I realized that it was much more complex:  I don't really know what I love doing neither do I know what's the meaning of my life.  It is not really about the school or something specific but I am lost in my thoughts with no self-confidence, no clues and no going back.I am also afraid of taking a decision and changing my life.  I don't even know how to properly make a decision because back when I was a highschooler I thought that going abroad and studying in a good engineering school would make me snap out of my depression.    
 But guess what?  It did not!  And don't get me wrong, I am not regretting going abroad but it isn't at all the solution to my mental state.  
 I am highly confused and lost, I don't know what to do or say and that is most probably showing up in my writing. I feel I have got a potential but I don't know how to unlock it or reach it.I am constantly stuck in the darkness and I am not feeling very useful.   
 Adding to that the pressure of wanting to make my family proud while also living the life that I'd like to live.  I am trying to hide this from my parents who live away from me because I know that they most probably won't understand and that it will worry them a lot. That is not due to a lack of intelligence obviously but due to them being raised in a different generation and also due to the fact that they have done the impossible to help me get abroad and enroll in an engineering school- which was my decision- hoping that it would be for the better: and I can only understand their standpoint.  
  But what if it is not the solution?  I did extremely well during the fisrt semester but that wasn't the solution: it didn't relieve my pain or mental suffering.I ended up having a major breakdown: I am failing my 2nd semester miserably (not attending courses, being completely disconnected from school,...). I don't really care about school results but what I do care about is that I snap out of this state and actually have a dream and a passion to fight for.

Sometime I just think that I am piece of shit for not being responsible and giving up (especially when I look at people my age that are working relentlessly and that actually have their own goals) but I just can't keep up with this miserable life: everything around us is fucked up (the school system, society, moral values, judgements, money ruling everything,...). I have already thought about dropping out or maybe changing my school or just doing something with my life but I am too afraid of what will happen. The unknown is scary and I don't know if I am tough enough to endure what will come. (even if I stay in my current school)

Yesterday, we just had project presentations in a Computer Science class and I didn't present my project: a project that I haven't worked on for months now. I felt too bad seeing talented students presenting their projects. And while it did inspire me and lift me up for a moment, it certainly didn't make me snap out of my depression and anxiety.

I am lost and depressed... I don't want my story to end this way. I feel like it is too early to give up and too bad of an end to a story that has barely begun.

This post is not meant to get people to empathize and pity me because I am not a victim. It is rather meant to seek advice from people that have gone through similar experiences and anyone that can actually help.

Your help will be much appreciated.

With Love,"|1
"I'm trying to word this the best way I can to get some insight on what this feeling/reaction might be called that I often experience.

Some examples of when I feel this would be say I had a bad day at work or something at work happened that really upset me. My first reaction is to go online, look for new jobs and find a way to leave my current employment so I don't have to deal anymore with how that bad day affected me or may affect me in the future. More like I want to run away from it so I don't have to deal with it.

Another example would be say my husband were to come home and tell me he got in trouble for something at work. My mind would immediately think he was fired. Then I begin planning how I will leave/divorce him if this happens and how I don't want to be involved in the situation at hand. Once again, running away. 

This feeling I guess comes when something bad or negative happens in my life and I want to run away from it or have nothing to do with the situation anymore. Could be a person or place. 

Any insight would be helpful. Thank you."|1
"Hi guys. Recently I’ve been feeling very down and upset, and I am not always sure as to why although a few things are stressing me out currently. 
Let’s say that I have struggled all my life with stress and I think I might have anxiety, maybe ? Tbh I’ve never been diagnosed so it could be that, or not (I’m not a doctor obviously so I most certainly am wrong)

What I have noticed is that, unlike before, I am starting to feel like I REALLY want to die, and I think about ways to end my life. 

I do not want to talk about it to my boyfriend because I do not want to be a burden. He is a pretty outgoing/full of life type of guy and I do not want to be a dark cloud around him nor to be that annoying girlfriend and lose him. 
I do not want to talk about it around me at all actually, because I do not want people to worry about me like that or their help to be overwhelming/not adapted... although that’s probably what I should do

Idk guys... I’m just not feeling ok inside, at all.
(I apologize if some of the things I wrote aren’t written perfectly, English isn’t my first language)"|1
I’ll probably hit an all time low (no not suicide) it’s all I have left the only light in the darkness while I see all others around me succeed I’m stuck at the bottom alone with other faceless entities who pretend to care but to absorbed in their own problems myself included. I’m currently waiting to see what happens but I’m already anxious and depressed as what will happen is probably set in stone completely out of my control just like everything else in my fucking life.|1
"Well, I tried shooting my shot again with a girl I thought I was clicking with. We had made plans today, (Friday 5/28) to go out to eat and hang out for a little bit. I brought it up a couple hours ago asking if she had thought of a restaurant and she kinda just made up some excuse about being busy in the morning. After I asked is a later time better, she just stopped responding all together. I just check back now and she removed me from Snapchat. What sucks is I know this girl irl.

I don't get it. Every girl I've gained the courage to talk to or get to know, eventually they stop responding. I'm not the best looking thing out there. And yes I do have low self esteem but I'm working on that. I'm just tired of being ghosted. All my friends have wonderful relationships or are able to have that one female friend they can talk to about anything. That's all I'm looking for. Maybe I really do have a face only a mother could love. I guess I'm just too repulsive to want to be associated with. I just hate being lonely. Only thing keeping me company are my thoughts of inadequacy and failure.

After so long, you start to think that you're just a giant ""no"" to any and everyone around you. I wish a could exchange my mind and body.......clearly no one else wants it."|1
"I don't have any friends, and its becoming too much. I am truly alone. I have my partner, but I don't think he loves me. I am unlovable. 

The days are getting longer, I am becoming more and more miserable. I am alone, and the sad part is, no will miss me I mean I guess my partner might, but like they will get over it.

Why can't I enjoy life?"|1
Whenever I get suicidal thoughts i think of everything i’ve ever done wrong, no matter how small. And that triggers physical pain inside my chest, it’s almost like my body’s saying: “You’re right, you’re worthless”. It’s trying to hurt me as much as I am trying to hurt myself.|1
"In the world to fix me. My therapist told me to hold onto hope. That things can get better … I think there will always be disconnect with people with depression and those without. Maybe she doesn’t understand how damaging hope can be. 

I don’t know what to do if I give up on therapy but I can’t keep calling the tech support line and have them ask me did
I restart my computer. It just makes me feel unheard and as if my life is a cruel joke. How could I possibly go to church when I feel tortured by the idea that a god would put these “hurdles” in my life. I’m not sure what else I can do when I’m in control and I have no clue"|1
"I just want to be normal again. I'm always tired, never get enough or decent enough sleep. I'm in constant pain from prior injuries to lower body. My joke was at least my upper body is still good. And now I have a new one. Torn shoulder labrum. Never had a doc give me pain pills. Was told to either deal with it or take ibuprofen. Had one straight up tell me to take 3000mg of Tylenol. I'm suppose to be moving to another state to start school and get my life going again. But now I'm looking at 9 month recovery time after surgery. So school and shits back on hold. Again. Fuck I've been in this limbo for over 6 years. And now I'm 25, married, and living back at my parents house.

I even stopped getting drunk because I had a temper issue after everything. I still drink cause I love the taste but I'm careful and watch myself. When I'm feeling tipsy I'll swap to water. If I'm around family(parents mainly) I especially I won't drink hard liquor, just beer and not pounding them. Also I'd be afraid I'd hurt my wife emotionally which is a whole different case. Biggest issue is they try to piss me off when I'm having a drink. I'm a dude that 99% of shit I don't care. But they know what pisses me off and try to get me worked up. 

My wife, I love my wife and I'll do whatever I have to for her, but holy shit I'm going insane. She has issues and I knew that when I married her and I'm trying to be there for her. But fuck she'll have a random panic attack then it's ptsd night for her and I'm trying to calm and help her. She'll keep me up to 2-4 in the morning cause she's having a panic attack. And if I'm not completely coherent (awake) she thinks I'm upset with her. She actually thinks that alot. And I make sure she knows I'm not. Then she goes and buys a pack of cigs, which we both quit. And if I don't go smoke with her then she gets even sadder. She asked me the other day ""what's it like to not have suicidal thoughts everyday?"" Fuck wish I knew but can't say that

Dont have anyone to bitch to. My mom use to tell me I could vent to her but she just cries and makes me feel like the asshole. My dad, no I dont get along greatly with him anymore. My wife, I kinda can but she's not someone I can explain to(she has her own shit) and I don't need to add to it. Dont really have anyone else anymore. I dont remember the last day I had to myself. No one ever gives me time. I'm starting to worry cause I'm having weird fucking thoughts that make me think I'm literally going insane. Keep thinking everything's not real then I have to talk myself out of that thought. FUUUUUUUUUUUCK

I just want to be good again. I can't even do my old hobbies anymore. All I do is wait around and have tv on in the background. I want my life back. I want to be able to walk without pain. Sit without pain. Laydown without pain. I want to be active. I want to know my mind isn't going to break

If this isn't the place to post this I'll delete"|1
I’m young, smart I have my whole life ahead of me. I have some setbacks I’m female and half black. But there are plenty of successful black females. My point is if I worked hard enough I could do anything surgeon, scientist, lawyer, investor or writer. But for some ungodly reason all I want, all I can think of is how much I want to die. Everything wrong with me is in my head. In science, I am thinking of anaesthetics that would numb me enough so I can slit my throat without too much pain but not so much that I won’t be able to move. In maths class I’m thinking how it probably would have to be a cream and how I would have to try it on my wrist first just in case it doesn’t work. On the way home I’m trying to remember to search anaesthetics that would do this. All throughout this I know I’m not going to do this. I couldn’t do it to my family but still it is all I want. It has been all I’ve wanted for a while. I don’t need people to tell me I will get better or that it will get easier in he comments, I don’t need sympathy or recommendations on what will help. Simply just an acknowledgment of my pain.|1
"I feel horrible, I don't know if I'll ever get better. Yesterday evening, I found out a close friend of mine who lives far away blocked me on Instagram. I had a panic attack and started crying. I texted him to ask why he did that and he said his therapist advised him to ""take a break to think"". I don't really understand social cues, but the only time someone had told me that it was my ex partner, only for them to break up with me a week later. I'm so scared he's gonna do the same. 

He told me he couldn't explain because he felt really bad and couldn't talk to me right now. 

I don't understand what I did. I know I had been insensitive the day before by insisting I wanted to see him this summer despite him having to spend all summer with his dad who was sick and old. I apologised because I had been selfish tho, and I don't understand. Really the confusion of this all situation is what's making me feel the worst. I want to know what's happening, otherwise it's making me so anxious. 

So I missed school today because I felt too bad for it, because I spent yesterday evening crying and couldn't do my homeworks. I also have troubles eating and sleeping because I'm in so much pain. I don't know what to do I just want everything to become like before, I just want us to have long interesting philosophical conversations again, I just want us to emotionally support each other when our depression is acting up again, I just want us to recommend each other movies to watch and books to read randomly again. I'm in so much pain, what do I do with this pain?"|1
Ive struggled as long as i can remember but have finally reached a point where I have to get help or i wont make it. Can anyone tell me what to expect? If im honest and admit i think about dying every day am i gonna get medicated to hell or something else?|1
okay so I was just watchinhg youtube and suddenly it hit me, man, I don't have any friends, it really sucks because I had a friend group a while ago (online) and we got into a fight so i left it, i have to admit it was pretty childish of me and i should've apologized but yeah, that left me friendless, i reconnected with an old friend from school a month or two ago and just a few days ago she told me to shut up when we were talking, I'm a sensitive person so it hurt. we don't really talk anymore. i don't have any friends now, zero! i mean, I do have people added just that i never talk to them. i don't have friends in real life either. i hate everyone in school and am just a loner. I'm not even ugly or weird (i think), i just don't get it. i am shy though. sorry for posting such a useless thing i just i don't know- I'm feeling down, its weird because i feel normal sometimes and then at night BOOM, i get sad because i realize how lonely I am. the more i think about it, I've never even had true friends, like for example, I've introduced my friends to other friends in the past and the two of them end up getting closer and become bff and just ditch me. thats why im so insecure and have trust issues. im planning on just giving up on friendships and just going on with life without friends (as well as starting dating bc all my crushes just end up in failure) because it seems pointless. ill always get heartbroken in the end. it really hurts sometimes. my grades are good, i don't have any problems at school im just incredibly lonely. i also don't know where im going in life, i don't hang out with my mom or dad a lot because they're always at work and my little sister is just annoying. like, think about it, i have nobody im just sitting in my room typing away. i have no friends, nothing. sorry for the vent but thanks for reading, id also appreciate just any thoughts anyone has to say, this is also my first post anywhere on Reddit.|1
"A bit of a harsh rant, but I'm seriously frustrated right now, might delete later.

Therapy has been such a shitty experience for me. All I've been met with is incompetence, incompetence, and more incompetence. They keep answering my questions with more questions, and the whole experience feels fucking stupid, like I'm paying to be trolled. 

I'm a fairly realistic person and I value actual advice and solutions over baseless platitudes and moronic statements. It feels like I'm talking to a brick wall, and they don't even see me as human.

Some therapists need to have their teeth knocked out and their license revoked. 

I remember having an awful week of mental hysteria and feeling like I was going to bang my head into the nearest solid object every minute. I told my therapist that I didn't know what to do at this point, and that I needed her help. Her response word for word was ""I think you know what you need to do"". 

Didn't book another session with her.

I've changed therapists several times now, and the one thing the all have in common is that they take ZERO responsibility for their patients, to the point where it feels like they don't even care.

I'm probably going to jump off a building any one of these coming days. Because I'm just done.

So to the people who've told me to ""go to therapy!"", this is for you."|1
They say life gets better. Well, I have a job more money, my own car, gf, etc. Guess what thought. I’m more miserable than I’ve ever been. I hate depression. If I could take someone who wants to live incurable disease, I would gladly do it.|1
"Therapist says I'm going through a lot of loneliness. And it's true. My ex ghosted a couple years back and I haven't found any women since. 

I don't like leaving my house. I have a couple friends but they know better than to ask me to do anything. I'm awkward. I can't talk to people without fumbling my words.

Oh well my feelings matter just about as much as me, aka they don’t

I hate myself"|1
I’m a failure..! Failure in education, bullied in school, college and now work. My parents never understood me.I am 30 and have no love life..I am getting panic attacks since 7 years now besides that i have 0 confidence even when I’m having a normal conversation..because of all this I started stuttering..I don’t know what to do..can someone please help?|1
I’m embarrassed to reach out and be rejected.|1
"It's hard, I'd say, when your doing a chore that seems so completely easy but it feels so hard to do, when I just want to drop all of it and just straight up start wailing, but I didn't no matter how hard I try because I live with my family, and I hate to think that I'd just be burden when we're in a hard situation. And I'd just completely shut down, just staring at nothing and just talking inside my mind. I can do work, I can do chores, take a bath or cook but I'd be completely empty and exhausted. 

Id be jealous of all the people that are doing well in life. I have high grades, I study hard but because it's not what I want to do but it's what I feel like I have to do, maybe that's why I feel like I don't have a future and I just try to have a good education is because I don't want anyone to be disappointed in me. It just sucks really."|1
How da fuck am I supposed to live like this I just can't I really can't do this anymore, I'm trying but I just can't, I say I wanna get better accept myself and all that shit but holy fuck it's impossible, I'm stuck in a body that's full of issues and a mind that's full of negative shitty thoughts with absolutely no one by my side, I'm so done of it all I truly genuinely wish to just die, I need this to end|1
"and I’ll probably do it again.

I have been suffering from depression and noticing the signs of suicidal thoughts since I was seven, I have been dealing with it for years upon years and I finally snapped, and tried to kill myself.  I obviously failed and I probably will try again, I can’t take it anymore. I’m a piece of shit nobody that really has no use, I literally have no friends, all of my family hates me, my romantic life is as barren as a desert and I have no one to blame but myself, all I can do is sulk and be miserable to be around. I just wanna be happy, I don’t want to be a burden anymore. I can’t take just sitting in my room alone trying to distract myself with YouTube videos."|1
Everyone can see it. My friends that have all outgrown me, my exes that threw me away like garbage like I deserve, my family that has consistently treated me like shit for my whole damn life. There's no part of me worth appreciation, or remembering, or loving. Everyone is better off without me, I can tell so easily. I just suck the life out of everyone and everything. What good am I? I'm a worthless little shit who can't even fall asleep. Who can't even brush their teeth. I'm a failure and a loser and I ought to have been exiled from society by now. All I do is whine and bitch because my fucking brain doesn't work but that doesn't excuse anything. The only god damn thing I want anymore is to give up, but people insist that that is somehow going to hurt them. As if I mean anything to someone on this god forsaken planet.|1
"March 10th I had my last cigarette. I was pretty adamant on not smoking anymore after about 4 1/2 years of smoking. Started when I was 18. I will be 23 in about five months. Tonight after a couple drinks I had my first smoke since I ""quit"". Life has just felt so shitty lately that I don't see a reason to care anymore. I haven't cared in a while. I know it's not going to end well for me. I've accepted that. I just don't know how to convey that to my family. I know my parents never liked my smoking, nor has the rest of my family. How does one let their family know they don't care about themselves? That they don't see value to life in any way? I'm not asking for pity, just asking for suggestions on how to tell my family that I don't care."|1
I think i have an inferiority complex because i feel like everyone is relatively better than me,I hate having a intellectual disability i try to compensate in conversations by trying to sound smarter than i actually am.|1
"I'm not ok I'm hurt.....
I make every one around me suffer I am a leech im to scared to die but I have no will to live.....I just want to diaper  and watch everyone else's life go on seeing how much better they would be without me seeing how much a burden I really am...I want to hurt more so maybe it will drive me to do what I can't accomplish...and atleast then I will be getting what I deserve I feel i deserve the pain but I dont want it anymore I think its because I'm alive that I want to hurt and that dying will solve the problem...life won't miss me...and the people that will are few and far between...I'm not saying they dont matter I'm only saying that them being sad Pale in comparison to the joy they will get to have if I'm not here....I hurt, destroy, and disappoint everyone and everything and that not an over statement in the slitest.   Its fact.                         I'll just wait a little longer till I have no choice but death i only feel sorry that they all have to put up with me a bit longer...."|1
"I am at my end. I have been just hanging in there; get up, shower, go to work, exercise, go to bed and do it again. Last week I could not. I drove to work and turned around I went back home and I just lost it. I have not been back since. I can not keep doing this it is pointless and I want to get out of my mind. Turn my mind off. I want this torture that is life to end!!! 

I don't want to hear ""you are not alone"", ""I'm here if you need to talk"", ""you will get through it"" etc etc.. it's all B.S 
I have all the things you are supposed to have (House, acreage, boat, trailer, jet skis, pets, husband, kid and on and on and on. It doesn't matter because I hate myself and can do this anymore. I have tried volunteering, I donate money and all that. I can't do this anymore and I don't even know why I am even posting. My husband deserves better, everyone deserves better. I am the one making life miserable"|1
"BIG TW suicide, self harm
I don’t want to over share, be vulnerable, or ESPECIALLY seem attention seeking. Okay let’s begin.
I am 13, i live in a privileged town. I have a nice family, only 2 friends and i don’t like one. I have a few problems. I get su!c!d@l and depressed at night. not all nights, but when i do, it’s really bad. I self harm, but i have a phobia of cutting skin so i rub my skin hard or hit myself. i know it’s bad. last week i went overboard and left myself a pretty bad burn which i regret now because EVERYONE pointed it out. not doing that again. I do get su!c!d@l thoughts but they aren’t serious, because i know i’m not going to kms. not even up for debate. BUT i do wish i was never born, because i feel like i’m weighing everyone down and i’m a waste of time and effort and money and space. 
 I am seen as a good kid with basically no problems, so how tf am i supposed to tell my parents this?? they’d freak out. but at the same time, i’ve dropped so many hints that i need help. like i’ve dropped some MASSIVE hints. that’s why, i don’t even think they care. like yeah they care but why don’t they help me? i’ve literally said “i need help.” they’re accepting parents and everything and they’re very loving and generous. oh another thing, i had a therapist for years on and off (the same one) but i literally never opened up to her. okay whatever. does anyone have any advice? i just feel so alone, i have nobody to vent to or talk to about this. thanks. bye"|1
People say, do what you like ,but im doing what i want and i follow my hobbys. But there is no joy in does things when doing it alone|1
I think I have a serious mental illness. I don’t feel right at all. It’s like something is holding me back. I’m a virgin, never dated anyone(I’m a 28 year old black male btw), no job or career(my parents are letting me live in the first and older home while their a few blocks over at a newer property, and have been a major help for me during the pandemic, and I am so so so grateful for them.), I’m 465 pounds, with a newly restarted gym membership, and I feel that my weight is irreversible. Maybe because it will take a long time and dedication to lose so much of it, I don’t feel I have the strength to do it, and I’m being as vulnerable as I can be. I’m on citalopram for my depression and anxiety and that shit ain’t working, idk what else to do beside putting a bullet in my head tbh.|1
"I am in a bad place in my life. I am not a catch whatsoever. I mean, I could be heading to prison in a couple of months. I'm trying to quit alcohol, weed, Pristiq, and eat decently as well. I go for a walk most days, and I am applying for part time jobs. I have no job right now. I have some gross self-harm scars that will basically signal to anyone that I am ""damaged goods"" or whatever callous term people choose to use these days. I have very little extra energy, and I already feel like a loser for doing so little. I'm less up to the strain of interaction and being ""charismatic/funny"" than usual, and I really don't have a stellar personality to begin with. I don't have much to offer so I usually just ask questions and listen until they run out of things to say. I don't do very much. I feel tired allot. I did this to myself. When I was young, I guess I thought I was kind of unique or something and things would come around. I would be a famous author or something, and I wouldn't have to do the petty bullshit like small-talk. Obviously I've grown out of those feelings over the years. Well, I'm just sad that I'm missing out on certain experiences that I will never have. I don't know when I will be a stable enough person to even get into a relationship that's worthwhile. My pessimism says I will be in my thirties by then. I know its vain and shallow, but I wanted to be the young person, the desired and the pursued, a specific type of stereotype they have in the gay community. I won't go further than that. I don't want to do some gross hookup thing out of desperation just so I can say I'm not a virgin. I feel so childish complaining about this. Whenever you say this stuff, people just tell you that its overrated and that you ""need to focus on yourself"". But I've been focusing solely on myself for decades....I'm 24 now and I have always been reserved and anxious.  And I hate when people say that shit. Obviously, a wealthy man can hand-waive a loaf of bread, he has already had it, and he has the ability to get it in abundance whenever he wants. I want to just get over it. This has popped up at the worst time. I guess I thought I would be an adult with a living wage by now and the whole social thing would fall into place. I was so wrong, and I wish I had tried harder in high-school. I feel like I have brain damage or somehting and like Im so far behind. It makes me think that I just want to die. If I can't have this little dream, I guess I will end up a even more bitter and miserable middleaged man. Living on a deadline is miserable. What the fuck is the point. I am to weak to actually kill myself. I never had the guts to do it."|1
I've had the same job for 4 years now, I'm well liked as far as I can tell but everyone thinks depression is my personality, I've been called mr. Personality,  ee or the donkey, squidward, marvin the robot from hitch hikers guide to the galaxy, I go along with it, i think it's funny, not sure if that's good or not but no body should have to live with depression, i have my good days and bad, on the bad days people say, oh that's just how he is, that's normal, but something is bothering me to make me feel and act that way, I dont want people to feel bad or ask what's wrong or try to help, because they cant help me, I just want them to understand depression is not a personality it's an illness|1
I know that being around and supporting someone with depression is difficult. I know it’s a burden. I understand why friendships are hard to maintain. I know a friend absent of mental illness doesn’t benefit from being apart of my life. How do I make it up to the people I want to keep in my life? Are words of endearment or gratitude not enough ?Is it even possible to have friends? Do I give up? Thanks for letting me write out my feelings. I hope everyone keeps fighting the good fight.|1
"I don't think I'm meant for this. For life. I'm so scared of getting a job because I don't think I'll do well at anything. I get overwhelmed too easily and feel too stupid to learn any new skills, much less retain them. I can't even drive yet because I'm scared of somehow fucking something up while learning.

I relapsed in self-harm today.
 It's been on and off for years, I don't know if I'll ever break out of it. My thighs are bloody and bruised and scarred to hell. I just wanted to see what I feel on my body, the evidence of the damage.

I feel like so much was wasted on me. Potential, hope. My parents expected so much of me because I was always a ""smart"" kid, but that's limited to academics. I do well in school, studying has always been easy for me. But because of that, everyone thinks I'm someone I'm not. Capable. I feel so guilty that I've mislead them into that.
I don't know what to do. I want to kill myself, before I have to go through everything I'm dreading so badly. I probably won't, I don't think I could do that to my mom.


Don't know what I expect from posting this, but if you've read through my half-delirious vent here, thank you."|1
I admit it. I am. Everyone acts as though I have no right to be. I have every right, this world had it out for me for a long time. I feel hopeless, and no one shares my resentment. Maybe it's a good thing.|1
"So I just graduated high school, and I know what you're thinking ""Oh that's a good thing, you should be happy."" Well now I have to go and pretend to be ok in public and I have to keep saying ""oh I'm just tired."" I don't know if I can keep it up I don't know how to ask for help, or if anyone would even believe me, so I pose a question to you, Reddit, how do I pretend to be ok so that I can be a functioning member of society? Is it even possible?"|1
"My best friend died last week. The last thing I said to her was a lie. All because I didn’t feel like hanging out. Now everything is falling apart. I was the 2nd person to get to her apartment when she died. I haven’t been able to stop reliving her boyfriend saying “she’s dead” or the way the cop called her “the body” instead of her name. My best friend was the most caring, sweetest person I had ever met. She wouldn’t even kill ants. 

Her mom called me yesterday to tell me it was my fault, because I didn’t force her to go to the hospital when I knew she was on drugs. No one understands I tried. I tried to convince her to go. I knew her drug use was bad, I knew she needed help. It is my fault. 

Now I lost my best friend, our other best friend won’t speak to me, our other friends won’t speak to me, my relationship with my boyfriend is deteriorating by the day, my sister and father told me that I was being dramatic when I was crying the day after she died and now I have this crippling anxiety, I can’t deal with it I need it to stop I can’t get this pit in my stomach to go away. I don’t want to do it, I want my friend I want to hug her I want to talk to her my life feels like nothing without her. I just want to go be with her."|1
"I don't get angry at anyone else. Ever. Any bad coincidence? My fault. You dropped something? My fault. You're angry at me for getting food? My fault, shouldn't have wanted to eat. You get the point. I don't ever get angry, except at myself.

And except at a video game called Ark. It just doesn't make sense. Sure, that game has so many bugs and just bad programming that it's probably not unusual for a stable/normal person to get frustrated. But me? Logically there would be so many more things that would deserve my anger. I just don't understand why this out of everything makes me mad.

My friends really like Ark for some reason, so I guess I'll have to keep playing that walking virus. To be honest I'm a little bit overwhelmed with the anger. I don't really have experience when it comes to dealing with anger at others, don't really know how to handle it. And it's even more frustrating because I don't know why this out of everything angers me."|1
i have no goals i have no motivation i can’t convince myself that anything matters. my meds are working (i think) so im not completely sad all the time but now i’m just. empty. i’m about to be a senior in high school and i can’t see myself in college much less actually doing something after. and part of me doesn’t even want to. i used to have so much drive and i used to want to learn everything possible and now i feel like im wasting my youth or whatever and it doesn’t even bother me.|1
"Im trying everything to change. I started working out and all that “this will help you” stuff but nothing seems to be working. On 12 march I decided if nothing changes even after 3 months i will kms and well its gonna be 3 months and tbh i tried. I dont think i have the guts to kms but i almost jumped to death so um idk what’s happening I really dont wanna live, maybe i do tbh idk i dont feel good. I dont think once this “suicidal” feeling sets in, it doesnt go away. I think i will be like this forever, no matter what i do or what i become cause these thoughts will never leave my side. I just hope i dont wanna do something in the heat of the moment, if i kms i wanna plan it perfectly not like someday i felt extremely overwhelmed and kms. 

Anything else yall want me to try? 
I swear i will
I will do anything to change myself and get rid of these thoughts forever or at least for some time."|1
I just don’t know what to do anymore I’ve tried everything to make myself not feel lonely. Everyone i know is either dead or has completely abandoned me I’ve tried rehab programs and AA but they have done nothing to help me fill this lonely void in my soul. I dont want to be like this anymore  I wanna be happy again.|1
When I was little I lived with a very abusive mom and step dad. Then I was raped and I never told anyone because I was little and scared to be hit again. I'm out of that house now. But my dreams are so vivid it makes me want to kill myself.|1
"Sorry, this is really long.

From literally as long as I can remember, I have been seeing all sorts of therapists and psychologists due to my social anxiety and selective mutism. I have always been very shy and anxious around other people, and hardly am able to approach other people. Thankfully, my situation has much improved over the years. In elementary school, I was identified as one of the ""gifted"" kids, and was given a lot of pressure by my parents to score the top three in the level every year, and it always felt bad whenever I could not achieve it. 

In middle school, I realised I was gay. My country is relatively conservative (gay sex and marriage is illegal), so this wasn't good news. I was mostly fine, though, because the youth are generally relatively accepting. However, once, at a party,  I found out that my best and almost only friend, A, (I was never good at making friends) was openly homophobic, calling homisexuality things like satanic. I had always known A was very religious, but I thought that he might still be fine with it, and had actually been planning on coming out to him (I hadn't told anyone at the time). So, obviously, that hurt like hell, and greatly damaged my self esteem and belief in friends. I didn't really have anyone else to turn to, so I still stuck with that friend, who was so caring about everything else, which just made it even worse. I felt like an imposter, wearing a mask to be his friend.

My family is also very religilious, and my parents would promote very similar sentiments as A did. It had never bothered me very much, as I wasn't close to my family, but somehow, after that incident, everything started to affect me much more.

Because of this, I fell into a deep depression in high school, something which worsened my anxiety. I slowly distanced myself from A, and found another friend, B, who I eventually found out was bi. I eventually came out to him, and he became my best friend, and would help me through panic and anxiety attacks. At this point I was extremely suicidal, and B was the only reason I held myself back. Eventually, our relationship evolved to a sort of unofficial dating, with kissing and stuff, but he never let me show any affection in public, saying that he was pressured by societal expectations, which made me feel really bad about myself, like even B was ashamed of me. He also said he intended on marrying a woman eventually, so I felt like just a fling, someone he was using for a while before he got round to serious relationships. Don't get me wrong, he really did care for me and love me, but he was just so affected by society it seemed to overwhelm that.

Over time, things seemed to get better. B managed to stop me from cutting myself. I forgave A and came put to him. He told me that he had changed a lot since then and no longer had those views. I started making more friends. I was still depressed, but things seemed like they might actually turn out okay in the end. 

And then everything went wrong. B and I had decided that it was better if we cut down on all the physical aspects to our relationship, since it wasn't going to go anywhere. But one day, when I went to his house, we were just lying in bed together (it was a normal thing for reasons I'm too lazy to explain), and then he tried to touch my d***. I told him no, and he reluctantly relented. But then a few minutes later, he just did it anyway. I was really disoriented there, and quickly left, saying I had to get home to do work.

I talked to him about it afterwards, and he seemed genuinely apologetic about it. But even then, the fact that his hormones could just overcome his love or care for me and lead him to sexually assault me has given me problems with self esteem and self hatred and distrust of people. Whats worse is that he knew I was very sensitive about the topic of sexual assault. I keep thinking 'how could he do this to me?' And now it feels like I have no one else to turn to or talk about it.

My mental health is at an all time low. O have anxiety and depression, and I frequently contemplate suicide. I would have done it already if I could find any painless way to go.  Psychologists stopped working a while ago. I don't know if I just improved much faster as a child or I've just been using the wrong ones. I'm so lost. I don't know what to do."|1
"24M
I must share with someone.
Lately I’ve been feeling like falling into a deep dark pit with everyone around me not realizing it. I have no idea how to communicate it to anyone, and have no idea how to fix myself. Therefore I’ll just type out whatever I’m thinking about right now.

I feel like a failure on so many levels..

I’ve been an engineer for two years, I quit my last job after 8 months because of the stress and pressure. everyday now I spend at home in front of my parents is a reminder that I’m a quitter and not up to a real life challenge. (A lucky fresh engineer here earns ~ USD $600 a month full time which is not enough to live in my own place)

Ever since graduating University I wanted to continue and get a higher degree in a country abroad.. ultimately I want to live abroad because the conditions in my country have been terrible for decades.. This year (after delaying my plans a year before) I applied to get a visa and due to unforeseen circumstances my visa application won’t go through and now that dream feels so out of reach and I feel exhausted and drained.. feeling stuck.

Through all of this I keep getting thoughts and feelings of regret that my chosen field is not the right field for me and I feel so terrible like I wasted 4-5 years of my life and then I decide that this isn’t the right pick for me.. what’s worse is that I have absolutely no idea what IS the right field for me.

I’m struggling.. really struggling.. I have an addiction to masturbation and pornography.. and I realize to some this may seam stupid.. it probably is. But I only recently started realizing what a grip this addiction has on my life.. I used to look at smokers and not get how they can’t just stop putting a cigarette in their mouths.. all this time I had my own addiction.. and it’s everywhere in my life.. I can’t stop.. I don’t know how to stop.. I need to stop. it has a grip on me so hard I actually can observe how it’s making me a sick person day by day.. it grew from once every whenever to once a day to twice and more.. and the porn is everywhere on the internet it’s right there when I open my phone.. I can’t stop.. I don’t have the will power.

My last demonstrable show of will power is the fact that I lost about 20 kg (44 lbs) in 2020 .. from 134 kg (295 lbs) to 113 kg (~250 lbs) I wanted my life to get better.. and my health to be in it’s top shape because I wanted to live a long life. I’ve since regained about 10 kg (22 lbs) and now I’m trying to lose them again. I lose my control around food and I have no idea how to keep myself from it.. it just takes over me and I hate myself when I do it.. I hate myself so much.. like yesterday I actually wanted to do some sport so I walked 12 km (~7.5 miles) around the city
Which was great.. even though my legs were hurting.. I felt amazing.. but today I ate lots of chocolate and junk food.. I ruined myself.

I studied university abroad.. and this really hurt my social circle back home.. at University I was so preoccupied with doing well academically.. that I failed socially.. I have but a few friends in University.. and I didn’t even meet a special girl to experience relationships during that time.. even though I got a high CGPA at graduation.. I regret it.. because it came at a price of being kind of a loner with a couple of friends at most.. now that I’m back home my Uni friends are far away and I barely have any friends at home.. I have only bits and pieces of people who I can call a social circle and more than half of them live in other continents.. living abroad taught me so much like how to depend on myself and so on.. but I kind of wish that I had more time here or there to make a good social life... and now I decide to do it all over again by going to a new country to study (if that works) and it just makes me anxious and scared of starting this all over again.. after it i’ll almost be in my 30s and won’t have a solid stable social life.. but I do wanna go abroad again because tue situation here is not that good

Moreover.. I failed at every attempt in my life to get to know the feeling of being loved by someone else (romantically speaking).. I was rejected a couple of times.. and I never had a girlfriend.. I always told myself that my academics are more important and I don’t have time.. fuck that I only said that because I was too scared to go out there and get to know people... my friends were out with their gal pals and I was studying and literally crying myself to sleep because I need to someone to be with me.

Sometimes I blame it on my past.. I used to suffer from “night time involuntary urination” where i had no control during sleep and i would just urinate every night.. This stopped when I was in early 9th grade.. and I only have bad memories left.. horrific nightmares.. it was hell.. I hated myself so much when I was little.. because I’d wake up everyday to being a failure once again at being a normal kid and embarrassed.. sometimes I think this probably affected my self-confidence in the past few years of my life.. but who knows..

Now.. I find myself rolling deep with dark and disturbing thoughts.. inappropriate ones too. I’ve done some stuff that I regret and feel bad doing. And All if this is a mental warfront between me and myself.. I can’t stop thinking and feeling somewhat depressed. I don’t know how to feel better and get a grip on my life.

I know this probably sounds like i’m making a huge deal from small problems.. I acknowledge that in fact I am blessed in that I’m not poor, young and I still don’t have health issues.. but as I said.. this is a war of thoughts within me.. if I am really okay.. why do ai have depressing thoughts and confusion inside my head then.. I can’t be all right.. I’m sick and disturbed.. at least I feel so.

TLDR: lots of mental disturbances and depressive thoughts."|1
"16 years I've been plagued with this monster. 16 damn years of fighting off demons and putting on my happy face mask. I'm tired as hell and I just don't see the point anymore.  
  
Life was looking great for a few years there; had a great job, a happy home, a healthy body and was planning a wedding. Now? I have none of that. I've been unemployed for years due to health issues, some of which were caused by trying to treat my awful mental health issues, need to move out with nowhere to go, my health has progressively gotten worse thanks to mental and physical conditions, injuries and accidents and my relationship has completely fallen apart.  
  
I cry when I can muster the tears, otherwise I sit in silence and grieve the life I once had. At times I am transported right back to the teenager who harmed herself and cried all the time, saw nothing but hate and hopelessness. My therapist says I'm so strong and she's proud of me for not giving up, but why the heck should I not give up? What's the damn point of all this?"|1
"Just finished first year of college. Pushed myself insanely hard to get good grades, and got them, but at the expensive of my mental health. Felt kinda suicidal. I don't now, but I feel more depressed than ever. 

I feel so sad and sick. I have plenty of time to ruminate and sleep. Lots of sleep. I genuinely want to just sleep for a year. I'm so exhausted all the time. Even going out with a few friends is unfathomably tiring, but I have to keep doing things so that nobody guesses what's wrong with me... 

Idk why I'm posting this...maybe someone can relate. I'm tired. I need to go to sleep, probably."|1
I’m such a piece of shit loser I hate myself I just want to cry and let my emotions out. At this point I don’t even think I have any I’m so fucking dead inside and used to depression at this point. I’ve kept my emotions hidden and locked in a safe for so long that I can’t even let them out when I’m by myself. I’m so fucking done with this shit I want it to end.|1
"I feel like I'm sinking.

Will I be able to come back to the surface.

Should I even try to.

Drowning seems inevitable for me."|1
It’s taking a toll on me playing this happy guy that always cracking jokes and making people laugh but deep down I’m dying. Deep down I just want to be loved and have someone care about me but in my life that will never happen.|1
"Why can't I be a normal person? I feel like I constantly burden everyone around me. I feel like I constantly annoy my friends and I feel like half of this things i say is just me mirroring my friend and I can't take it anymore. 

I feel like every part of my personality is really just someone else's. I am constantly thinking of killing myself but I'm too scared to do it even though I don't have any reason to be. I feel like one of my closest friends is now starting to hate me. 

I barely feel anything most of the time I just mainly feel neutral. I have nothing or no one to live for or to turn to. I constantly complain about wanting help but then I don't do anything about it. I constantly feel like everytime I'm with someone they want me to leave constantly. I make so many jokes about killing myself that if I genuinely would no one would belive me and I constantly feel like I do everything for attention.

 Why do I have to be like this? Why can't I just be happy for once or maybe be my own person?"|1
I am so depressed because my university grades are so low .. my friends start to make fun of me and insult me. I hate my college and my whole life|1
I'm not sensitive, I don't need more time to figure things out, I'm just a failure.|1
"Hi,

Everyone who comes near me ends up in a worse place than before meeting me. I have a partner who I don't feel cares about me and doesnt let me care for her. It's been 4 years and she still won't tell her parents that she loves me. I feel like the past 10 years I've been repeating the same cycle and never coming out happy. Im stuck in a job that won't fire me or give me a raise. I don't get along with my family as every problem or argument I have ends up being my fault. I've read alot of posts here and I want to feel like im not alone anymore. 

Life has been hell since childhood it may not be as bad as others but it's enough for me."|1
"My father died 4 years ago and my mother is a complete narcissist. Long story short, she took half his stuff when they divorced and since he didn't change his will, she took the rest 3 years later when he died. 

Christmas 2020, she got me 2 scratch off tickets and a t-shirt from her company store. I feel like I'm always fighting off this little depression monster on my shoulder, but since Christmas, I hadn't talked to anyone in my family until last Sunday when my sisters showed up to my apartment. I'll usually go visit my older sister a few times a week, but after Christmas things just kind of spun out. 

After a month or two I wanted to talk to them, but something kept me from just sending a text back when they would ask if I was ok. 

It's been tough spending most of this pandemic alone, with the only people you talk to are at work and it's surface level relationships at best. You have to put on a happy face, pretend everything is fine, even when your co-worker calls you crying, because they are stressed and can't finish a project, you step in to help so they don't get fired, then 3 months later they quit and you get to add their job to the pile of stuff you do. I guess that's why I got MVP last quarter. 

I've put all my effort into work to try to stave off depression. At least if I'm helping someone there it feels like someone needs me around. But even that accomplishment is fleeting. It's been awhile since I've loved myself more than I've hated myself. I fucked up in the past and have been trying to be a better person, but I can't seem to let that go. I don't know where this is all going. I just needed somewhere to vent."|1
I'm 16 turning 17 in 6 months and I been really sad about it. I feel like I'm old and after I graduate everything is gonna be bad. Could someone help me out here please.|1
"I cannot stand how angry and sad of a person I’ve become since my ex-girlfriend gave up on me. Some people say that I shouldn’t let one person ruin my outlook on love, but when you put all your stock into someone, and then they give up like it meant nothing on top of ruining your favorite hobbies, something inside you just breaks.

I’ve done nothing but work on myself for two years and I’m no less depressed. Fuck you for using me the way you did."|1
"My girlfriend gets really upset because I didn’t move some boxes that I meant to move before I went to my first therapy session. This is where I always run into trouble. My family my girlfriend have never given me time to heal to be me. I’m only worthwhile if I’m being productive. If I’m not neat cheery or social I get attacked. I’m trying to find some joy in life but how am I supposed to feel loved if the moment I have a ptsd flashback, depression, or panic I’m deemed weak or lazy. 
I’ve been kicked out of the house for being depressed which just led to worse depression. I’m emotionally tired."|1
"To start off with some background, my step-dad is a certified a$$hole. Because of this i tend to get defensive. I'm a 19 year old female but somehow my defensiveness over little things can turn a 50 something man into a rage. How fragile the ego must be. I usually only say something if he makes comments or decisions for my mom or something misogynistic because he has no right to those things since he is 1: not and woman and 2: hasn't known my mom for that long (and since he's an awful man he usually sees the nice housewife side). That said I get defensive often because he can't seem to mouth shut and thoughts to himself and I've gotten absolutely sick of it. 

Now, recently whenever I say something, even when I dont think its fighting just explaining so he'll shut up, and he goes into pouty fit like a toddler my mom has started to say things to me like ""whyd you say anything. You know he gets cranky"" and ""you should've let it drop, now everyone's going to be miserable"". However I am a moody teenager with anger issues against an adult toddler who thinks he knows everything and loves to step on and talk down to you. So, in other words, I'm gonna say something and it shouldn't be my fault if he can't handle a MOODY TEENAGER with MENTAL PROBLEMS talking back and defending people for once. Heck one time there was almost an actually fight cause I was trying to defend innocent person I dont even like but it feels like I'm the only one with a spine anymore. 

Background over, real issue now.

A couple days ago he was trying to talk down to my mom again, while she was making his dinner, mind you. Now I was already in a bad mood so that sent me I started in and he started getting red in the face so for the sake of my mom I reeled it in and just went outside where everyone else was and the POS slams the storm door shut behind me. So my mom asks if I made him mad and why couldn't I just keep my mouth shut and I'm so sick of it always being my fault when he could've just kept his mouth shut as well that I couldn't even say anything and she went back inside. Next my sister starts going on about how she doesn't like him either but its better to just say nothing, its a skill you learn as you get older, thats just how all men and whatever else you get the gist. Now I'm crying because I'm so sick of no one ever taking my side and I'm always at fault so storm inside and run back to my room. I essentially just curled up on the floor collapsed in on myself 

That was Monday it has now been 3 days and I've left my room maybe 3 times just to pee. I've barely eaten anything because I just don't have the willpower. My mom keeps trying to talk to me but I dont have the energy or desire to talk and it seems whenever I open my mouth I get in trouble so its also been 3 days of not speaking. This isn't the first time an altercation with the POS has sent me into isolation in my room, but (probably due to the seeming lack of support) this is the first time it has sent me into a deep hole of numbness where I can't hardly move, eat or speak. Because of this my mom recognizes how bad situation with him is and offered to find somewhere else for me stay, but that honestly made me feel worse because it seems she'd rather send me away than to try to stand up the a$$hole.  I'm sick to my stomach and I dont know what to do anymore. I dont feel like I can do anything. I just want to fall through the floor and stop existing. Opinions or suggestions on how to start funcionting again would be welcome right now because I've never hit a pit this deep and I can't seem to get myself out of it

Edit: I've discovered the only time I can find the energy to speak is to say hi to my cat"|1
"I’m seeing my therapist next Tuesday I think, but in the mean time I feel like I’m close to just..losing my shit basically. 

I have a hard time with relationships and jobs because I look into every small action and immediately trick myself into thinking it means they hate me.

Usually if I focus on my mental healthy and stay as positive as I can then I can usually talk myself into realizing this is my depression trying to win the war, and I won’t let it.

Recently though my job, that I love, has lost all its workers besides me, my boss, and one other person.

My specific department requires a minimum of 3-4 people to be run efficiently and give all employees proper breaks and days off from work. 

The other department needs a minimum of 2 people for this.

So total we need 5-6 people. 
We have two. 

We lost all our workers in a matter of weeks.

Any time my boss corrects my mistakes I think, “ I’m already failing. She hates me. I should quit.” 

I *just* started “school” to further my education so I can get a better job. I applied months ago and let my boss know months ahead of time that when I start school I’ll only be able to work 2 days a week so I can focus on studying and school work. 
My boss understood and respected this. Even encouraged it and said I’d excel. That I was smart and I’d absolutely make something more of myself than this crappy job that barely pays more than minimum wage. 

Well, I’m starting now and instead of 2 days working I’m literally working 5-6 days, sometimes 7. Meaning my 5 days of classes and school work I’m shoving into TWO DAYS. 

I’m tired. 

If I quit my job so I can focus on school I’ll be a failure. A loser who can’t keep a job. 

If I quit school to focus on work I’ll still be exhausted, but I’ll also never get to further myself and constantly make excuses to hold myself back. 

I’m working two departments to help pick up the slack. 

If I leave then they’re stuck doing all the work. I’ll be an asshole. Selfish. Inconsiderate. Unreliable. 

I can feel myself slipping. I’m crying right now. 

Yesterday i laid down and stressed myself out so bad thinking about all of this that I couldn’t breathe. My chest was hurting. I wanted to give up.

I want to give up. 

I don’t want to fail though. 

I don’t think imma be okay for much longer. 

I can’t stay positive when I’m surrounded by negativity. 

I need help and advice"|1
"throwaway: This will be a long one. Our 11 year old started getting angry at the end of last summer. He wouldn't do things like chores or even want to do things he enjoyed like hiking or biking. He would get very emotional over very small things. Into fall, he was having a tough time with school and not making friends. He has always had good grades and been a pretty good kid so it was really noticeable how his behavior changed this past year. We live in a northern climate and chalked it up to seasonal dark / cold and perhaps COVID.

His school was in person throughout the year but many kids did home school and his class was very small. We got him into therapy which really didn't go anywhere or do much for him. After the holidays he really started getting out of control. Hitting us, hitting his younger brother, breaking things in a rage, grabbing kitchen knives, threatening suicide, opening the passenger door on the freeway threatening to jump out. We pulled him out of school and started getting treatment from a psychologist & psychiatrist while keeping him home. I stayed home with him for 2 months on FMLA leave. Things were rough for a month or so but then he got noticeably better. He was diagnosed with severe depression. 

We got him back in school for 4th quarter at a different school. Things were going great. Kids and teacher he liked. They had a close contact with COVID that made the class stay home for the week. He absolutely tipped over one day. He threatened to assault his babysitter, who is a close family friend he has loved for years. Hitting / choking my wife, smashed holes in the wall and wrecked a spare bathroom. 

We took him to a mental hospital for 3 weeks and he was released when he was stable. They changed / boosted his meds, anti-depressant and anti-psychotic which is terrifying. But he wanted to come home, was / is working on getting better. We have him set up with outpatient therapy / camp 3 days a week at one place and trying to get him services for 2 days a week at another. He was excited / anxious about summer camp this year but already got kicked out of one for disrespecting property, threatening other kids / staff at a place today. Things have been better at home since he got out but we have had some setbacks as well. 

From our perspective our kids have a ideal childhood. They want for nothing. He hasn't been through any trauma that we know of though we do work a lot and they have spent time in daycare before and after school. He has never mentioned any sort of abuse or trauma. He just gets sad, then mad, then sad / embarrassed about his behavior. 

Has anyone else been through this before? Either themselves or with family members? My wife and I both come from dodgy family situations with divorced parents, poverty, drugs / alcohol abuse when we were growing up. We may not be the best adjusted parents, we probably yelled and lost our tempers with our kids too much when they were younger. But we haven't done any sort of corporal punishment with them since they were babies (light spanking). Neither of us do drugs or drink, we are both very successful in our careers, we're not super strict and we don't fight with each other. Our kids have a good stable home in a nice area and plenty of resources to help him get better. 

He is working now on developing some better coping skills for handling his emotions. He has a very tough time with other groups of children. We participate in his therapy sessions and have been reading, listening to podcasts about this stuff from day one but I honestly feel just exhausted like we're going in circles some days with no signs or hope for improvement. Obviously the whole family is suffering to a degree with this. I just can't help but wonder what is the endgame here? How many therapists do you need to go through until you connect with someone? Are we going to have to eventually put him in a special boarding school so he can function? What sorts of things really help in situations like this? Is therapy / medication really the only two things that will make a difference? Is there anything else out there that can help a child with depression that the doctors don't suggest?

Thanks in advance for advice / suggestions"|1
Since january I've been getting worse and worse. nothing bad happened of course, i just don't care about life no more. the bad thing isn't the numbness tho, it's that when you don't care about anything you have no motivation nor drive for nothing. everything becomes harder, which enhances how meaningless everything is. i dont want to be awake. the funny thing is that I'm gonna force myself to workout so I'll feel better, and even tho it works, i still won't give a shit. yeah working out gives me a huge dopamine rush, but it doesn't really help. I'll feel euphoric but still empty. No reason to post this, i just shared what i feel in the moment and I'm sure someone will relate to this|1
I was diagnosed with borderline personality and I’ve been in a abusive relationship for 4 years and my mental health has really  gotten worse, he started off cheating on me anyway he could at the beginning then we would fight a lot , he kept breaking up with me and we kept rekindling but now I just wish he would break up with me and leave I regret asking for him back , I never knew it would get so bad and trust me when I say there was so many good times but now I’m destroyed... he started getting really violent we unfortunately live together, I’ve never hit him before in my life but a couple weeks ago he called me a lot of names and I smacked him in the forehead and I was left fighting for my life , I received a black eye and he received nothing like always .. I never used to be like this , do you guys think 4 years of really bad emotional and physical abuse can make you deteriorate? I’m trying to find a way out ... I need to get better ... I’m close to really just going you know ? I AM scared for my self because I don’t want to go , but please ? I do not want to stay.. I’m stuck . ( update - I love him with all my heart and I want him to succeed but physically I’m just not capable of doing this anymore or I’m gonna die ) I never deserved what I got this whole 4 years and I’m afraid of life after .|1
"I don't care to progress in life anymore. I blew so many opportunities and I'm nowhere. I'm sick of everyone's false positivity. 

I'm lazy stupid and crazy

I had so many plans for myself I know I'll never achieve I'm crazy for thinking I'd ever achieve them

I'm stupid because I don't understand simple things. I've always been the stupid one. I'm smart enough to not be put on disability and to have hopes and dreams but so stupid to the point where I'm just fu*ked and won't ever achieve anything. It's a curse.

I'm lazy because I'll quit before I even begin and don't put effort into anything. I haven't even brushed my teeth or washed my clothes when I should have. I keep missing deadlines and I know I'll miss more

I'm a hopeless case that will never get anywhere. Sure I'll daydream and daydream some more about this life I want that I never put effort into it. I'm too lazy stupid and crazy for it to happen

I had a thousand places I wanted to go but this world isn't meant for someone like me. Someone so anxiety ridden. Someone so lazy stupid crazy. I want to float away from all of my mistakes. 

I feel like I'm already in hell and I'm getting tortured. I feel like there's no way I can get out of this life. No way I can climb out of this rut."|1
Look for an app that send me random reminders of the good things about myself. I am battling consistent negative self talk, and could use a little positive reinforcement. I am working with a therapist to see the cognitive distortions and question them, but it would be helpful if I could leave random reminders to make sure the good self love outweighs the mental tear down. I live on my own so it's hard to catch the negative thought spirals I end up sometimes and it would be nice to be able to reflect back on the day and find something positive. But yeah ever heard of an app that does this?|1
"I managed to get my sleep schedule back, waking up at 8 am, go for a run, shower, brush my teeth, eat decent meal, yoga meditation, read, chilling with hobbies, music, study. Everything felt amazing. The weather was perfect,wasn't too hot nor cold, mixed of sun and rain. Rainbows, thunder, storm. It was beautiful, really impressive. Feeling the nature. Felt alive for once. 


Today it was sunny as hell, no clouds, blue sky, heat, insect, pollution. Even I managed to get my routine done, went for a run and so on. 

But this afternoon, there were too much noise outside, people, cars and rodeo. And suddenly everything was bad again. I hate spring 

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK"|1

Does anyone sometimes feels like really bad, like, this is it, i can't do this anymore, but at the next hour/day you feel okay? because that just happened to me.|1
i can’t think of anything else to say. it’s been in my head nonstop for weeks and i’m terrified. i went around my apartment testing to see how strong the closet bars are. they wouldn’t hold me and that’s why i’m still here. i don’t want to do it. i’m not myself though, and whatever part of me i am wants to go to sleep forever. today, the urges are very strong and i’m scared to be alone. i don’t want to worry my parents because apart of me feels like i’ll never do it. another part of me feels like i could make it so fast and painless. i’m crying out for anyone. this is my third and last time.|1
Am I the only one who thinks weed does not help with depression nor anxiety? Matter of fact, it makes my anxiety worse and whenever I’m high, I’m just high and sad. Which is the worst combo.|1
I’m under a lot of stress at the end of my school year and it’s been making me break into a cry almost every night. I tried to just rant/vent about how fucked up I feel to my closest friend and all she could reply was “what am I supposed to say? Like I can’t console you. Just try your best and don’t let it get to you.”  She means well, but I really wish she didn’t say it like it was so easy. I didn’t expect her to pity me or console me, I just wanted to vent to someone. I don’t tell my friends my problems, but I try to support them the best I can when their having a hard time. Whenever I did give hints of my depression or anxiety to my friend all she could tell me was “don’t overthink it” “ you’re fine” . I may be overreacting, but it hurts when she says those things to me. I regret saying anything to her. I know I shouldn’t share and expect anything. I distanced myself from my friends and know that they wouldn’t really notice. I’m a selfish piece of shit and should leave them alone.|1
"gay  29 year old man from the middle east here. been through a lot. homophobic family that would disown me if they knew i was living my life as an out gay man. currently live in the US (moved here for college and been here since) and largely don't speak to them. 

never been in a relationship despite trying very hard. used all sorts of apps, have a decent social life, and have a therapist/psychiatrist and am on anti-depressant and anxiety medication. still. nothing seems to work out. i don't feel a sense of belonging anywhere. didn't as a kid. still don't know. i rarely ever feel a sense of connection with anyone. it really makes me feel like there's something deeply wrong with me. everyone seems to have a very easy time meeting people, falling in love, and being in relationships. i, on the other hand, am perpetually single, anxious, and depressed. no family, no partner, no consistent emotional support in my life (aside from therapist). 

i feel intense pain and envy when i see couples in public, when friends talk about trips they're taking with their partners or even just casually mentioning their partners, etc. it feels like it's something i'll never have. i also have really bad body image issues that have become worse now that i have gained weight during the pandemic. 

idk if life is worth living. i constantly feel like shit."|1
"Sure, it will be said that ""whatever reason that causes people to not want to live is irrational and/or temporary and/or can be fixed with whatever treatment/therapy/support"".

But why is society so hell-bent on keeping people as prisoners of this world when they do not want to be a part of it? In some cases, people simply don't want to exist in this world; the mere concept of existing in this world causes distress. But society would rather force these people to live against their will, going as far as locking them up in mental institutes to ensure that they do continue to exist. From an utilitarian point of view, wouldn't it just be better to allow these people to take their own life? Is this just a relic of the past where strength came in numbers and we needed ""every possible human"" to ensure survival of the species? With an increasingly overpopulated planet today, this argument obviously doesn't hold anymore, if it ever did.

&#x200B;

I don't want to exist these days. I'm heading towards my 30s - yes, still young, but I don't feel young anymore. I used to pride myself in my aspirations, dreams, ambitions, good health - all of it is gone. Some of my dreams, I'm too old to fulfill. Others, I had to renounce. My health has gone downhill in the past year with the apparition of a chronic illness, despite always taking extremely good care of my health. It just feels like life is simply a roulette game where nothing is in your hands. Things will happen to you out of bad luck, and the illusion of choice that you have is nothing but an illusion, since you're predisposed genetically to make your life decisions that ultimately shape your path. If I can't control anything in my life, why can't I at least control whether I want to play the game or life or not? I'm sick of it, yet I'm forced to play it."|1
somedays i feel motivated af planning for the future and shit, then i go days thinking how life is pointless and thinking about death. it’s like the motivation is dying slowly everyday and this dark state of mind is going to win eventually. like today in the morning i felt great af now i just hate everyone and everything… i need help|1
"I had a talk with my family several days ago and they basically embody all of the myths behind depression. I was suicidal once again and they told me I’m jealous of my siblings, I want attention, I want to bring emotional and financial trouble to them and my boyfriend, and that people who kill themselves are crazy. 

All of that hurt because I still disagree with them. I give up trying to explain mental health to them now because I really did try and I’m getting the feeling that they’re not trying as hard as I am to understand it all. I’m just looking for validation here. In your opinion, are suicidal people crazy?"|1
"31yo single male. White collar professional, educated with two grad degrees, good enough income with a new exciting job. I work hard but have a good wlb and work out/run 3 times a week. I think I’m decently handsome and a good catch. I’m not overly lethargic other than from work, enjoy traveling and seeing my family and friends. Will go on solo adventures often because I’m confident and enjoy spending time with just myself to reflect. My diet isn’t the best but try to eat more salads and fish. I’m 180lb 6’2 lean so I’m well within my normal body weight. I like to volunteer one weekend a month and try to spread love and understanding to my fellow man/woman. Overall content with my life. 

All is good. Except it doesn’t feel like it is.

I’m attracted to women and find them sexy and cute and all that. I’d be open to guys too, no problem there and comfortable with my sexuality. Just don’t find men attractive in that way. 

Yet I don’t feel the need to chase the opposite sex anymore. I have barely any sexual urges anymore. I don’t remember the last time I had a full hard erection. I’ve masterbated but almost have to force myself to get in the mood, and my erections are much softer now than when I was younger. Honestly my sperm isn’t as thick and plentiful as before either. I masterbate like once a month...if that. Completed the 90 day no porn challenge with ease. In fact didn’t care to bust a nut on day 90 and was another week before I did and wasn’t even all that horny.

My PCP says my recent blood panel is good except low on vit D which I’ve started supplementing. My testosterone is within normal range. No other physiological ailments as far as my doctor and I can tell.

I haven’t had sex nor a relationship since age 24. My last girlfriend was in grad school. We broke up shortly after finishing our program. Which means I haven’t been intimate with a another human being in 7+ years. 

I find myself forcing myself to scroll through dating apps. Match with beautiful young professional women on Bumble all the time. Been on a few dates in the past few years. Don’t care to follow up and tbh would rather just stay home than go out on some nights.

Recently have a new neighbor down my condo hall who we’ve hit it off. She is attractive, mid 20s, single, a young physician resident. Last time we hung out she tried to kiss me. I respectfully took her back home saying she was drunk and wasn’t going to try anything (which is true). She thought it was sweet that I didn’t take advantage of her....but also, I legit just wanted to go back to my place and go to bed since it was late and a work night. I had no sexual urge to make out and go for more. And she is quite attractive.

What’s wrong with me? I like the idea of having a SO long run and maybe even children. But right now in my early 30s and I can’t be bothered. What the hell happened to me in the past 7 years?"|1
"I looked around at my surroundings, and I said to the first girl I've become close to in years, the first conversation in months:

I'm pretty much at the tail end of a graph like this 📉  and I think you deserve more than that

And we parted ways before we acted on things. Pre-emptive strike against the collatoral of my mental health.

This was self-sacrifice for someone else. I know I can endure it, so I'll endure

I'm happy that my condition can be kept to myself. That's the uplift.

I've learned to treat myself like the tank in an RPG - suck up the pain of others because I'm hardened to it, because I don't matter, so that others can move on cleanly and forget

'Okay, good luck' she said!

I half hoped it would be cherry on top for a final leap of faith..."|1
"I have Major Depression. It unraveled after I had an existential crisis back in Jan of this year 2021. Words can not even describe the depths of hell I have been to, they really can't, so I won't get into describing it that much. I'm just simply looking for some thread of hope. Has anyone been able to overcome their depression? Or at least been able to get to a point where they are functioning and enjoying life again?

I follow this youtuber, ""Bignoknow""(check him out, he's a great outlet of support for those suffering with depression and anxiety), and I recall hearing in one of his videos that people with severe depression often are 100% convinced they're never going to make it out, but it is indeed possible to make it out. So, has anyone here made it through this? This is awful, the weight on my soul everyday literally makes me feel like a pile of blah that barely has any aspirations to do anything. Also is there anyone else here suffering from existential depression? I want to know if other people have this and how they are coping. Peace ✌️"|1
Its terrible when your crying and you literally have no idea what to do you feel like you cant turn to anyone for help because youre too socially isolated. So you just sit empty and crying and wondering how the fuck this happened|1
I feel like a waste. I’m never happy with my situation I’m terrible at making new friends because my interests are pretty niche and even people I share common interests with usually just decide I’m not worth it and start avoiding me when the leader of their group decides they don’t like me. I got a job that I thought would help me feel better but it’s already starting to suck after a week and not even seeing a big pay check is making me feel anything. I suck at school and have to retake classes because I failed half of them. Also I think I might have ADD but I’ve never been diagnosed and I don’t like the idea of doctors. My only close friend who I keep up with lives several states away from me now and I also live in a state in which I know literally nobody but my coworkers who don’t really like to talk to me anyway. I was happy for like a year and a half when I found a girl I really connected with but she lives on the other side of the country and I also got insecure and ruined everything. (Still crying about that one) I’m terrible at school and suck at everything that isn’t music related and I’m not even sure if I can make a steady career in that. I just feel like everyone who’s involved in my life is wasting their time on a total loser who will never amount to anything. Oh also I keep losing weight and I can’t find the will to eat because I feel so down. I just feel like I’m falling apart and can’t make good decisions. There are so many times in my life when I should’ve been killed by say cars, or a fall or seizures that I just wish I died as a kid or something.|1
I’ve been on Lexapro and Effexor and I just felt more tired, which is exactly not what I want to feel.|1
Hi, I’ve been waiting on getting antidepressants for about 7 months now and it finally seems like I might get them soon, but I’m feeling anxious about it. I think they said it’s either sertraline or fluoxetine I’ll be taking and I was wondering if anyone could tell me their experience with either of these? I’ve heard from some people that they just make you feel numb, and if this is the case I don’t know whether there’s much point taking them as this is how I feel the majority of the time anyway. Thanks :]|1
"
A few days ago I tried to stab myself with a small pair of precision scissors out of curiosity because I wanted to see where my pain tolerance levels stand. I only felt a shock of pain of the sharp edge trying to pierce through my abdomen but I was scared to push any further so I stopped. It's fortunate that I didn't go through with it but I was also disappointed in myself because I couldn't handle it, this left me confused as to why was I feeling upset at my failed attempt. It should be a good thing that I wasn't successful, but my best guess it's that I wasn't able to penetrate through so I couldn't really test my pain tolerance the way I wanted to. (In case I ever needed it, I know scissors isn't the best tool but I didn't want to use a knife on this small test)

I have had a history of self harming with most common techniques like wrist cutting, bashing my head against solid surfaces, beating myself, biting. I did get professional help and therapy and haven't hurt myself but overtime I had convinced myself that it's okay to hurt myself as long as it's not fatal, I don't see self harm are bad as others do which I know is bad. I've noticed I unconsciously convince myself to hurt myself in some form or another without realizing how it can scar me. 

Every now and then I get intrusive thoughts that build up my curiosity and it leaves me asking myself irrational questions such as, can I handle burning my hands, overdose, suffocation and this leads me to temptation into trying it out, I've noticed it keeps escalating into more dangerous attempts and was concerned if this is normal behavior. Do you guys think I need therapy again or am I overthinking?"|1
It seems every other thought that runs thru my thick skull is about harming/killing myself. At what point should i become concerned? Ive been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, bpd, manic depressive disorder, ptsd, add/adhd. My brain runs rapid to the point i can hardly keep up, but the reoccurring thinking process always ends in my death.|1
I am 24. I have been a hairstylist for 3 years and honestly, it's not as enjoyable as I imagine. I love doing hair color transformation but hate cuts honestly. But throughout my 3 years, I honestly am starting to get sad and uninterested about doing hair. What might be the reason? Not feeling like I have a clientele, having to deal with petty drama at work, some clients are honestly assholes, and etc. But now I do want to move on and want to tell my boss I am quitting. I do love her and think she is a great person, but honestly have guilt of saying I want to leave after all she is done for me. Now I am stuck on what else to do with my life. I have so many things in my head and I am about tk turn 25 soon. I don't know why but I hate the fact that I am 25 and I have to feel like I am too old and wasted 7 years of my life not finding my true career. Any advice?|1
"I’ve come to the realization that “family” isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be. Them being related to you doesn’t automatically  mean that they can’t be evil, spiteful and abusive towards you. It hurts even more when you are already struggling with mental health issues.

Years and years of this has taken its toll on me. I’m not perfect, but I do try my best to be supportive towards my family when I’m needed, and have even made sacrifices at the detriment to both my mental and physical health in order to try and help. And I honestly don’t regret doing so. But, whenever I need someone, it’s always a problem. And what little support I do receive is given begrudgingly, or with ulterior motives. If they do decide to help, they continuously hold it over my head to gaslight me and make me feel worthless while telling me how “lucky I am to have them“ all the while. I no longer have the ability to trust others. I’m fearful of forming any sort of relationship (both platonic and romantic). I also have an unhealthy habit of bottling everything up inside, and don’t feel comfortable confiding in others due to numerous incidents  of having things thrown back in my face to hurt me, and having personal info that I’ve previously disclosed to certain immediate family members in complete confidence told to the rest of the world without my consent in order to be used as gossip. 

My heart feels so heavy, and I honestly just want to shut myself off from the entire world. I can’t move out because I have no where else to go, and I feel so hopeless…"|1
Well, I can say that I am a charge for everyone because in these moments I don't have any job, even when I'm looking for it I just can't find it, being a weirdo doesn't help a lot (because of being autistic and also bisexual). Doing everything wrong too, even when I don't want to do it wrong everything goes wrong anway, I can't talk very well, I can't say my feelings because no one listens and when it happens they just criticize. Everyday I think I should go to sleep and don't wake up anymore|1
"I am a man in his mid 20s. I feel as if i missed many milestones, most of them being social and occupational. I mostly worked in retail for most of my adult life. I recently got certified to become an ambulance driver, but i got so depressed that I quit on the second day. 

Because the first day, I overheard someone saying ""why is he even here?"". I dont know if she was referring to me, but I had a strong suspicion she was since she was looking right at me when talking to another guy. It made me feel defective, or that im not worthy of being there. My guess is that she said that because I dont talk much, and maybe she misconstrued it as me being a snobby asshole, when in fact im painfully shy, and I'm scared to leave the wrong impression on my first day. 

The instructor even said to me that ""if you keep doing that, you wont work here for long"". I think he said that because I was nervous, and slow to catch onto what he wanted me to do. When i finally got home, and mentally reviewed what it is he wanted me to do, i felt like an idiot... It embarrassed and discouraged me, because he wasnt asking me to do anything exceptionally difficult, I was just so self-conscious and weirdly detached yet over analyzing every single movement of my body and what my next word will be, what ill say next. The fact that I am so shy, and that i overall felt unwanted there contributed to my decision to quit. I also thought to myself ""If im so shy that i can barely talk or make sense of things then how am i to do the life saving work that i admire?"" This of course completely crushed my soul. 

Another factor to my depression is that my brother has an addiction to opiates, and his behavior is very toxic. I dont think he has much longer to live. I saved his life when he passed out on my living room floor, I had to give him mouth to mouth to resuscitate him. It was doubly depressing when the operator instructed me to give him cpr when he had a pulse, which is a dangerous intervention. It astounded me that a retard like her could even manage a job as an emergency operator. She should have asked me if he had a pulse first. Anyways, after i saved him, he of course went back to using, deflecting and projecting everytime I'd confront his self defeatist behavior (which i am now ashamed to say applies to me). This further aggravated me, and made me feel like this world is truly fucked up. He puts me down all the time, calling me a loser, that I'll never find love, I depend on my mom for support (which he does too btw, he doesnt even work, which is very hypocritical of him to say) its fucked up. I think he does this because I curse him out too, but thats because he constantly plays the victim, and leeches off of my mother and I who support him. This especially bothers me, besides from the most apparent and immediate glance, it reminds me of my non-biological grandfather who married my altruistic, loving grandmother and used her financial assets to his advantage, and sat around and drank all day. 

elaborating on my brother, due to his addiction and comorbid mental health condition, he could have experienced a delusion that led me to believe that certain people were going to try to hurt me and my family... Some of it was based in reality, which is what truly scared me... I realized later on that i let my imagination get the better of me, and that the story that he told me was untrue, but i believe it caused me ptsd. He told me this a week after i revived him. I was already thoroughly traumatized, but then this really drove me crazy. I was begging my sister and her boyfriend for help, but instead, they laughed at me and insisted that im crazy when all i wanted was for them to give me emotional support. I was there for them when they needed me, but it clearly wasnt reciprocated. Probably because of the nature and extent of the absurdity of what i was complaining about, but its the moral principle that really irked me. The fact that they wouldnt be there for me it was real or imagined... It showed me that im truly all alone... I entered a really dark period of my life afterwards. This was several months before i got the ambulance driver job which may in part explain why i couldnt keep it together. I admitted myself to a mental hospital because I was completely convinced that something bad was going to happen to my or my family, and my mother even denied my suspicions to the admitting nurse at the mental hospital even though she was equally scared of the possible outcomes if i discussed it with anybody. This made me feel betrayed. I am not 'crazy' though, i was just gullible and was decieved, and my own mother partially believed the things i thought, its just that she basically back stabbed me when it came to talking about it with others out of fear of judgement, which i understand, but it was completely at my expense.

elaborating on my grandfather, He was very toxic himself. Insensitive, nasty, verbally and physically abusive to me and my family... He and my mom would make me feel like a horrible son when hed tell her ""you gotta control your son, hes acting up"" when he was SO MEAN to me... He would hit me, and intentionally try to bother me when i wanted to be alone, and so i became argumentative, screamed, shouted and fought with him as any \*kid\* would. I think that objectively, most of his attacks on me was unwarranted. Im not a perfect person by any means, but a grown man shouldnt be hitting a fucking kid, or acting as childish as said kid by arguing with and insulting him.

I had no one to help care for her while i watched her die in the worst way imaginable. My uncle called me a ""wimp"" for being visibly upset even though he helped out less than i did and was begging for his help... How am i the wimp for that? asshole. He apologized later and i believe it was a lapse in judgement for him, it just pissed me off he'd say that when i was already going through alot, and thats downright hypocritical for him to say if hes doing less than me in taking care of her in her final days. At that time, my coworkers were stupid, gossiping judgemental assholes, which further wedged me from wanting to socialize.

At the time when my grandmother was dying, my side of the family was threatened by my grandfathers side. They seized all of my grandmothers assets while she was dying, and forcefully evicted us from our own homes even though that money really didnt belong to them... It was my grandmothers... She inherited it from my real, biological grandfather - not the non-biological grandfather who seized the assets she inherited. Its really, really fucked up... It showed me that theres absolutely no justice in this world... 

I lost my father to a drug over-dose, I never had a father figure, or stable male role-model. 

I never had a real girlfriend, I dated very briefly, but would end up pushing them away in fear of them rejecting me, or they would reject me anyways. It hurts me because I know that objectively I'm slightly above average in looks. I scored about a 5.5 to 6/10 on true rate me, so I know my lack of success in dating most likely isnt due to my looks, but rather the fact im so shy, guarded, and immensely depressed. My lack of girlfriends has lately been a very sore spot for me. I really didnt care too much for a while, because I suffered this really nasty sense of rejection, or game playing by this one girl, and that hurt me so much that it discouraged me from trying to date, and so i didnt try to date for about 7 years. 7 years later, i heard of this one girl thinking im cute, and she was absolutely beautiful. I think she played games with me. She would act interested in me, and then disinterested. What leads me to feel unsure either way is that she used to blush around me which i know is not something you can fake. Thats a physiological response.. you cant fake that. She told me i was cute and hot. She told me she wanted to go slowly because her last boyfriend used her for sex. I thought she was rejecting me, and to avoid further hurt, i distanced myself from her, because she basically gave me an ambiguous, ""hmm i think i like you"" kind of shpiel. She explicitly said she doesnt want to ruin our friendship which led me to think it was solely platonic, but then followed that up with ""i just want to move slowly because of my last boyfriend"" as if shes implying romantic interest in me. That confused the shit out of me and made me insecure which i know is an unattractive quality in a man, its just that im very direct and straightforward... if i like someone, i like them. if i dont, then i dont. It made me think she was playing a game, but in retrospect, maybe she really meant what she said and i sabotaged that by being insecure. She got a boyfriend a year later. To this day, i dont know if she did that because she assumed i lost interest since i distanced myself from her, or that she never liked me to begin with... 

I have a bad habit of self-sabotage... I also have the type of face that looks 'mean', which is partially true, but its mostly an unconscious defense mechanism of mine due to years of emotional and psychological abuse. I dont try to make that angry face, or resting bitch face, thats just how my face looks, and since im aware other people think that, it makes me nervous, and they would judge me for that instead, which makes me angry, and then I REALLY put the asshole face on... just because im aware of other people thinking that... its like a self-fulfilling prophecy.

When it comes to hastily quitting and starting new projects, namely when it comes to jobs, I think to myself, ""why even bother, you can do this other thing instead, fuck this, go ahead and quit."" I would then do that, and I've done that several times, but the more notable times being twice over the span of about 2 years. Id think that ""if im doing this instead, why does it matter if i finish this?"" etc. almost lacking the foresight that I'll likely change my mind in the future, and what im left with are multiple half-finished projects with no closure. Its almost like when i finally got the ambulance driver job, I was crushed with depression... I realized ""wow.. this is it... this is what ive been waiting for, however, i feel EXACTLY THE FUCKING SAME"" It hurts too much... Seeing how every single action, every single path i take leads me to my own grave, inevitably. 

  I intended to become an emt because I believed in the cause. I wanted to do something noble and meaningful. After experiencing so many traumatic events, my inner demons got the best of me, and left me feeling nothing but pure rage and hatred at the world. I feel internally conflicted. I want to do right by humanity, and move forward in life, but at the same time, I fucking hate everything around me. Its this awareness that led me to believe that maybe im better off in a different career path. I would feel really awful if someone died, or my actions could've caused someone to get injured or killed. I get so depressed that I just feel this 'fog' for lack of better words. Its like my mind goes blank. My mind is a very dark place, and in part, may explain why i wanted to get into ems to begin with. To fill that 'void', to uplift humanity and embody the presence of divinity. When i look out into this cruel, cold and fucked up plastic world, I thought that ems would deliver a deep sense of spiritual satisfaction that other careers couldnt even come close to emulate. I believed in the cause, but I understand that most days are hum-drum, of course depending on where you work, but the particular company I was at does mostly inter-facility transport (basically non-emergency emergencies). I feel pulled in 2 different directions, but ultimately, feel as if im not mentally equipped or able to disconnect my own depression and home-life/personal problems from work. This is a problem, and i realized that maybe im better off just choosing a different job, it just caused me so much grief and pain when i finally got there, and realized the reality of it. Its a thankless job, full of people with questionable moral compasses, and all in all, worsened my depression by miles.

TL;DR: So now, I feel directionless, alone, and angry since i quit my job that i worked so hard at for a while. all of that work was for nothing. about a year and a half and a couple hundred bucks down the drain. Im a failed idealist who feels that hes watching the world degrade and his brother slowly die. Ive experienced too many losses, too many injustices, too many rejections, mostly in the form of social rejection rather than romantic since that i didnt date much or care to date until recently. when my grandmother died from pancreatic cancer, no one was there to help lend a hand, and so it was all put on me and my mom. my nonbiological grandfathers side of the family basically stole my dying grandmothers inheritance leaving my family high and dry when it morally really belonged to us. My coworkers at most of my jobs were fucking assholes, gossiping and talking shit. I never felt like i belonged anywhere. my family and my own mother betrayed me, and turned their backs on me, and scold me for ""putting up the walls"" or just flat out not taking me seriously. I think im dumb or not good enough... My brother is probably going to die soon, even though i already lost my grandma, my biological grandfather (which i feel guilty about, beacuse he was trying to reach out to me before he died, and i wasnt there for him because i was already overwhelmed with sadness), and my nonibological grandfather (which im honestly grateful for, i fucking hated him), and i lost my dog all in the span of 1 year. I have no girlfriend, and feel like no woman will ever love me, because im absolutely broken and depressed. I thought it was due to my looks, but im often told that im a good looking guy, and r/truerateme tends to rate me a 5.5 to 6/10. I keep coming into contact with the worst people who are just so toxic. judging me for being different, aloof, and shy. I might have some autistic traits, although not clinically autistic... My brother causes me enormous amounts of pain, by how i had to revive him, how hed guilt trip me into thinking hes the product of my mistreatment when we were young. He convinced me that our whole family was in danger, and it was over the dumbest and most embarrassing thing that ive come to find is not entirely true. It made me look crazy even though im not crazy. Every option that i can think of that i could undertake depresses me, my family is shaming me for quitting the ambulance driver job which i think is stupid, because my life is meant for my decisions, i dont owe it to anyone else but myself to choose what i do for a career. I just feel so low, and i feel like theres no end in sight. Someone please lift me out of this hole."|1
people don’t understand. i just can’t go out i can but no to a party it’s just different in walmart i just get in and out. i’m scared i feel weak thinking about it i’d rather be in my house i feel so unsafe around big crowds i just can’t go|1
"I honestly wish I didn't have a family or husband right now. I just want to cease to be. I want to disappear for good, or even just start a new life somewhere. 

I hate me, even if others disagree. I don\`t think I will ever stop hating myself. I know it's a good thing to have a tether like my family, but sometimes the pain makes me think nothing is worth staying. I just want it to stop. Everything."|1
I'm tired of waking up. I'm tired of brushing my teeth. I'm tired of putting on clothes. I'm tired of going to work. Most of all I'm tired of talking to people like every is okay when all I wanna do is lay in a ditch.|1
"""Well Vic, we had a good ride, didn't we? This is it Vic!"""|1
I'm so much relieved about how i feel in these last days , just want to share it . I'm feeling good and it's been a long while|1
I feel like I force myself to do things, I feel tired, I feel numb, low motivation for anything in life, zero confidence, live with parents and just interact with them, try to put on happy face, kinda feel like a fraud or something. I been isolated for years and life beyond chilling at home feels very exhausting. I wish I had my own space to process and figure out my life. Struggle to even keep my room clean. Having one room to literally live in is depressing. I just want to go on unemployment again and stay home like I have the past year. I just want to sleep or something. And I'm always longing for some intimate partner I can talk to. Some pathetic fantasy LOL|1
"
My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost three years now. We have a great relationship in terms of communication, shared values and morals, same future goals in terms of marriage and kids. We’re both very hard working people, and we’re both very loving and gentle. 

My boyfriend shows me he loves me through actions and not just words (ie helping me with chores because I’m disabled and it’s hard on me sometimes, reminding me to take my meds, or a lot of cuddling) 

I show him I love him by taking care of him, making sure he’s on top of his health, getting him to start therapy for his anxiety, being a listening ear, and a shoulder to cry on 

But even with all this, lately I just don’t care to be around him. Sometimes I’ll tell him I need to sleep early so he can go home, or tell him not to come over all together because I’m not in the mood to be around people. When we do hang out, I’m sleepy, bored, agitated, irritated, and feel super stuck and stagnant. When he wants to have sex I’m not turned on in the least. The thing is, I don’t know if it’s because I’m falling out of love with him or if it’s because my clinical depression has gotten worse as a result of Ontario being on some form of lockdown for over a year ...

I’ve shared all these thoughts with him and the only conclusion we have both come to is we won’t know till lockdown is over. But is there no other way to know? I feel very confused right now and lost 

TLDR; lately have been feeling bored, agitated, irritated, and stagnant when I spend time with my boyfriend and I don’t know if it’s because of my clinical depression + lockdown fatigue, or because I’m falling out of love with him"|1
"So, my gf and I have been dating for almost two years now, and we both have to deal with our issues (depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts), though we both try to help each other as much as we can. But while I'm a 8 in a ""How fucked is my mental health"" scale from 1 to 10, shes most definitely a 20. Everyday, since we started dating, she says how much she wants to die, and how horrible being alive is. She says that she's not dead just because i asked her to not end it all a year ago. We can't afford medicine or doctors to help her, since we're both unemployed, and with each passing day, she hates herself and her life even more. Should i just... Let her go? I *really* don't want to, she's the love of my whole life, but... Her family is REALLY abusive (they are guilty of 90% of the things that lead her to be in this state of mind), and I can't do anything to help her, she need professional help, and I'm not a psychologist or a psychiatrist, nor can i afford decent professionals. We tried some free ones, but since there's a lot of baggage, they don't offer a second appointment. I love her a lot, and i don't want to see her suffering... I really don't know what to do, and my negative thoughts are killing me, since I've been doubting myself for the past year about whether or not I'm doing the right thing by keeping her in this world.
TL;DR: My girlfriend wants to end it all, and i can't help her in any way. Should i let her do it, even though i love her a lot?"|1
Everything is just so much and overwelming. Fun things are no fun because the little things stress me out. I was so exited about riding today and I couldn't enjoy it for 1 minute. School was so stressing and I feeled like my friend does not actually care about me. I do everything wrong. I called my sister to just talk and I started complaining about the horse today and then she told me you can't complain about animals and blabla. I just wanna f\*cking cry and scream forever. I'm back to school A WEEK. It already is to much. Someone just hold me please , way to close to a breakdown...|1
3 if those classes were D's but Idc at thos point ik just so happy I passed. I still have to take a week of summer school because I failed a class last semester but at least it's not the full course i have to retake. I'm so proud of myself for actually getting off my ass and doing it!|1
I can’t stand to look in the mirror. I’m simply ugly. I have blemishes and dark spots that make me cringe every time I see myself. I want a relationship but I can’t find anyone who truly cares about me. At the same time I don’t want a relationship because I’m embarrassed of the way I look. My best and only close friend just started dating my sister and dropped me. No one takes me seriously. I have no one real left in my life. Everyone who says they love and care about me is lying. I have so many people that I can talk to but none of them actually want to listen. I’m tired of being a burden. I just want to be a normal kid. I’m generous and never intentionally hurt anyone. People constantly point out my insecurities and abandon me. I’m supposed to be a tough guy, so I just pretend that nothing bothers me. Everyone who I’ve ever had a strong connection with has left me for some reason or another. I just want to be normal. I try my hardest to be nice and accepting of everyone but never get shit in return. I’m tired of being used for some hidden reason. All I want is real people to really love me for me. I just don’t wanna be so lonely.|1
So, start about a few of years back, around 2014, my mom and dad get divorced, this fucked me up, moreso than I already was. Then my mom gets custody despite her being a piece of shit, she meets a few guys and settles on this guy I'll call Andy, they were apparently doing cocaine and weed (which is legal in Oregon, weed at least, where I lived) for the past 2 years and eventually my mom's legs get paralyzed from the overuse because it killed brain cells. So a few days later I go to see my dad and I just stay with him. I need someone to say that they care about me.|1
I was so into him, he bought me flowers then after the date through texts he tells me he doesn't want a relationship. Why can't one good thing happen to me?|1
It might seem like no big deal but it's taken me 3 years to do this.  I was on Lexapro about 7 years ago.  It made me feel so normal I felt like I no longer needed it so I stopped taking it.  I guess I slowly slipped back into full on depression after some family and personal issues.  I was sick and tired of feeling sick and tired.  Sick of waking up and just wanting to go back to bed.  Sick of the physical and emotional aches and pains.  I'm literally sobbing in the bathroom right now so my wife doesn't see me. I just hope it works as well as it did last time.|1
Hi people of Reddit, if anyone’s reading this I appreciate the time you take to reply, recently I’ve been feeling like I’ll never have actual friends. I don’t have many to begin with since Highschool and now that I’ve entered college and it isn’t in person and only online I haven’t had a chance to meet anyone. I work at my job and I’ve tried to make friends there but everyone is not interested in doing so. I have one childhood friend who’s close with me but she lives about an hour away and she has a bunch of other friends. Part of me is just unmotivated to reach out and make plans with people since it feels like I have no friends. I know it won’t be this way forever once campuses open up again but as of now it’s tough to see others going and doing things with friends when I’m sitting at home. I know people will tell me to go out and keep trying but there isn’t anyplace I can go to meet people. In the past I’ve made friends with girls and they end up just not caring about the friendship and it left me wondering for a long time if something was wrong with me. I am working on trying to live and like my life the way it is but I feel lonely and I don’t know what to do.|1
Check out the ketamine subreddit. Good resource.|1
Were both depressed and its kind of a taboo subject. I just dont know how to talk about it with him. Were really close but but talking about deep stuff is a mew thing for us. Appreciate any advice.|1
During my sophmore year in high school, many of my friends started to betray me to the extent of calling me racial slurs and so on; I decided to transefer schools, in hopes of turning my life around, but once again I never made friends, and ate food alone for the entirety of my junior year. (Never told my family)Now i'm graduating, after a year of online school and decided not to attend my graduation ceremony. It's just depressing to know I never made any connections with anyone, having to sit it the toilets of my school for a whole year. In many instances skiping classes to sit alone in the restroom.|1
"We got our English assessment scores back today and I only managed to score 27/40 even tho I worked really hard on revising. Meanwhile people who didn't do any, got 30 and 35 out of 40. This really puts me down and now I feel like absolute shit. I'm so worthless, I don't even know why I bothered to revise in the first place if this is all I get in return. Honestly, fuck my life, it all sucks I'm good at nothing. 

&#x200B;

Feeling really shit rn and just wanted to speak out my mind, thank you for reading this."|1
"Been trying to figure out how to write this post for a couple days... 

Things are becoming overwhelming. Insanely hard university degree that I just can't find motivation to do, losing passion and interest in things quickly, got cheated on twice and most recently fell for a girl that went through a 4 year terrible relationship, worked for a year picking up the peices and always been there for her, was some what an exclusive relationship but she never wanted to officially date, (said from beginning) but I always hoped. But now she says she doesn't see me from a relationship perspective (there's a lot of backstory on that, she's a very genuine person) 

I don't wanna continue my degree, I don't know how I'm going to make money, I don't know how I'm going to move on, I don't know how I'm supposed to live my own life, I don't know how I'm going to support anyone in the future if I can't even support myself. I have a few close friends but not many. I feel like I've reached a dead end in life. Ive been stuck in my room working as well as wasting time cos I want to try take my mind off things but it always comes back.

Its been this way for the past year, and I've had many breakdowns. I'm 20, my parents don't really understand but I know their trying. I stopped going to gym, I barely eat anything except for breakfast like twice a week and dinner. 

It sounds really stupid honestly, there are people with way more problems, and way more things to worry about than what I do. My life is not hard by any means, it's just such an extreme emotional struggle that I can't put into words, and don't know how to deal with. I feel like I have a lot to give, and I know I'm not a bad person, I hate feeling sorry for myself and I know I need to get over this. I can't sit and wait for things to happen, but I'm so emotionally fucked idk how to make them happen myself. 

I don't know what I need or what to do, but I want to see how others have come out of the hole that I'm stuck in, because if anyone will understand, it's people who have posted or follow here, going through similar things. I know its not permanent, but I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel to strive towards. I just don't see anything at all."|1

"Hello everyone, 

This might be a long one, so forgive me.  


Today, I was diagnosed with depression. I've known for a long time I've been depressed, years in fact. I always thought about seeing someone for it, but living in another country for the best part of a decade and not really knowing the health system too well, I never 'got round' to it. 

Lately, it's been getting all too much, negative thoughts, dread, anxiety, constant intrusive thoughts about how much of a c\*nt I've been to other people, particularly in past relationships, wondering all the time when it's going to catch up with me. I guess it has. 

I am tempted to reach out to those I've hurt, but refrain against it. Constantly tormenting myself each day, with each day gradually getting worse and the burden I feel from it feels physical on my mind.

I was prescribed Venlafaxine (Effexor) XR 75mg for a week, to up it to 150mg afterwards. This morning was my first pill, felt a bit weird after it to be honest, and now generally feel like absolute sh\*t. I do have an appointment with a second psychiatrist early next week, for a second opinion on what I should be taking. 

I have no motivation, no aspirations and live in remorse, regret and fear. I don't go out anymore, but when I did, I would black out and get into all kinds of bother, fights, stupidity etc. and this also was a big part of my previous relationships. I've obviously lost those, too.

Now I am with someone who is very supportive, but I still feel anguish and pain about my past and what I've done, who I've hurt and I've lost quite a few friends over the past couple of years too.

I live in quite a small place, so the community is quite small, my ex from that turbulent relationship is now with someone I knew quite well, so pretty sure they all hate me. 

Anyway, this is a rant/advice type post, anyone else going through something similar? I've left out quite a bit, as I'm trying to put all my thoughts into words which seems pretty hard. 

Not sure if the medication is for me, I've noticed some side effects earlier today already.  


TLDR: New to AD Meds, not sure if I should reach out to those I've hurt, hope things get better eventually.

Peace everyone."|1
"I'm probably not the only one who feels like this and I'm not trying to label it as some new thing. I'm just tired of the same routine day-in, day-out. I wake up every morning where the only thing in my mind is wanting to go back to bed, and it feels like I'm living and functioning as society expects me to.

I'm about to finish my A-levels and move onto a degree, but I keep realising that I've missed out on what were supposed to be the ""best"" years of my life. I made new friends and then the only way I could see them for most of the past year is staring through a phone screen. Whenever I'm not around them I have this overwhelming feeling of loneliness even though I know I can just message them or arrange to meet them, but like, it just feels like I'm back where I was two years ago, a lonely mess fighting a losing battle with my own mind, and it's exhausting. My thoughts are so disorganised that most days I can't even finish a sentence or find any way of concentrating. I have no energy or motivation and somehow I'm expected to make something of my life.

Every time I think about my future beyond a degree I see nothing, I don't see any happiness or any kind of path that my life could take, it's just emptiness. Sometimes I wonder who emotionally closed off I've become and I hate that side of me, but then again, why would a man be allowed to express his feelings, without being told they're weak and to suck it up.

I don't even know if any of this post makes sense, I just needed to rant about shit........."|1
"I’ll try to make this short. 6 months ago I took amoxicillin and have had bowel issues since. No doctor can figure out the problem. (ER twice, gastro (colonoscopy, endoscopy, ct), another gastro, hemotologist, primary doctor, dermatologist, foot doctor. Have an ultrasound on my heart in a week, need to see if I have lymphedema). Everyday the bathroom is a major issue and I often say what’s so wrong with me. It takes me forever to take a shower because I’m exhausted and my OCD has gotten worse since this started. My germ issues have gotten worse. Today, the foot doctor asked if I have been to a doctor about depression. I said no, but my father has brought it up and the doctor agreed. He said he can see it in my face. 

Any ideas on how to make yourself better? I am going to set up an appointment with a psychiatrist."|1
Don’t really like to talk about this but this week has been very rough on me.  To most people I’m perfect freshman, strait As, playing two sports, and enrolled in the hardest classes.  But none of that makes me feel accomplished.  I just want to enjoy high school and to be loved by someone.  What about my family’s love?  Mother is a control freak who can only think about something in the one direction that benefits her, i used to ask my brother(about 7 years older) for mental help but he always gingers me “ tough love”, sister (about 12 years older) is very helpful but lives her own life cities away, and my dad helps me the most but it’s wrapped in my moms control.  My friends help, but they’re just slowing down the fire.  I barely eat what i need to live, rarely drink water, my relationship with my mom has turned me into a lier that doesn’t trust anything she says, i have no drive to do school work or practice sports. I want to change but can’t find a reason or someone to help me out.|1
"this is gonna be long, sorry :/

Im a 20M from the USA. I have had a great childhood, I come from an upper class home and have amazing friends and awesome family to this day. I attend a prestigious university and am very smart for my age... or was... before my situation happened. I was studying for an exam and was getting extremely stressed out and started to get some anxiety and depression because of this one fucking exam. My gf was so supportive and tried to help me and tell me everything would be okay. For reference, she is literally a 10/10 looks and personality wise. I’ve had so many people tell me how lucky I am to have landed a girl like her. We were so deeply in love and I honesty couldn’t believe how much this beautiful girl loved me. She was literally a goddess, and the fact that she fell for me... it was truly heaven, and... too good to be true. Anyways I took my exam, and my depression/anxiety lessened severely. My gf and I took a trip to Florida as we both are in online school. It was perfect, plenty of sex, tanning, and just a romantic and wonderful time. When I got back from Florida, I started hardcore studying again. However, my depression and anxiety came back full force, but this time I couldn’t get out of it. That’s when the insomnia hit... The fucking god damn cursed insomnia that has been ruling my life ever since. I slept 6 hours a night, down to to 5,4,3. I average 3 hours of absolutely shit sleep a night. Physically lost the ability to nap. My gf tried so hard to help me and confort me, but to this point my depression was insane and through the roof. Like suicidal depression to this point. I went four days with 0 sleep and almost ended it. But I ended up driving her away, the one person who truly loved and understood me, all because of my mental health and complete inability to sleep. I can now barley function. I am so depressed I only think of suicide, and the only relief I want is a nice sleep, but even with medication, I can’t even get it. I was a strong healthy male at 162 lbs. MONTH AND A HALF LATER i’m currently 137 lbs. Severge brain fog. Erectile dysfunction. Horrible fatigue. Not sure if I will be able to continue school at this point. It’s hard when you had literally the best life that everyone dreamed of, only for it all to be taken away. I have a great support system but none of them understand the pain that depression and insomnia have brought upon my life. This will all be over soon."|1
"Hello. I came here for advice on behalf of a friend of mine. 

For the past few weeks he’s been harassed by several people in a discord server I am unaware of. Mainly because he won’t tell me. This group of people treat him like trash they say his artwork is horrible and little to no advice whatsoever. Even taking it as far as coming to the server we share and continuing the harassment. Even the mods had to step in and ban every person who harass him. 

But it hasn’t stopped. Lately they forced him to draw his characters in horrible scenarios that I most definitely won’t like to comment on.

I’ve been doing my best to support him. I’ve told him several times to leave the server those harassers come from, To block them, to search for other places where he can share his artwork. But he won’t budge. He claims that the server the harassers have is huge and he can get payed for his artwork as well as show it to a lot of other people. 

Me and my group of friends have done our best to help him. All of us have told him the same things. But he hasn’t changed his opinion. I am really desperate and worried for him. He is a pretty good artist and he doesn’t deserve to deal with this bunch of crappy people. But this has been going for several weeks. Me and the ones who support him are just exhausted. We don’t want to give up but he doesn’t want to budge. 

What can we do for him?"|1
"This is a passage i wrote to be an intro to my ? {paper, story? I don't know what you would call it tbh}. lmk what you think.

I don’t remember much about my life. I honestly don’t remember much of anything at all. I seem to block out trauma as January seemed so much easier to recall in March than now. I can’t remember people, but I know what they taught me. My best friend taught me how to turn off my emotions on command. Multiple of my friends taught me that even when you know someone, you don’t.

I sometimes feel like I'm not actually here and that I'm some sort of angel or ghost. Almost as if the body I'm in isn’t mine. Maybe my old self got fed up and actually killed herself. Maybe that's why I'm here. To keep others from doing the same. Depression is a tricky thing because it can catch even the happiest of people. When I tell people I have severe anxiety and depression the first thing they say is: really? As if someone who looks and acts like me couldn’t possibly be depressed or anxious. Like I said, depression is tricky.

I had a terrible nightmare, and I'm dreading my life again. I'm bored with seemingly nothing to do. I'm just sitting outside right now because that seems to be one of the few things that doesn't make me feel trapped. I feel so far gone and like so many pieces of me have been shattered and beaten with a club. I try to be hopeful, but the pain outweighs that, and it's become so difficult to traverse this suffering. I'm so tired.|1

"I‘m very sick of no medication working for me. I‘m suffering from depression and social anxiety since I was 15 (today 21). My quality and will of life and self esteem sink always more and more. I tried all the SSRIs and SNRIs available in my country as well as moclobemide (MAOI), amitriptyline (tricyclic), promethazine, quetiapine (seroquel), wellbutrin, opipramol etc in high doses for many months. I tried 2 depth psychological therapies and one behavioral therapy (I‘m still doing). None of these ever did a thing for me, not even a tiny bit, only sexual side effects.

I also tried many many supplements already but maybe there are some I could still give a try.

I tried Kratom (tried countless strains, vendors, batches) does sadly have no big effect on me. Phenibut is cool but too addicting and I abused it too often so its magic is lost already years ago...

I didn‘t give bacopa a try yet and I have it here to use. I read it’s acting on GABA so big potential as GABAergics were my only key to success and symptom reduction. How should I start with it?

What was your experience with bacopa?
Regarding what were the effects like, what did they feel like, effects on depression, mood, anhedonia, motivation, anxiety, ESPECIALLY social anxiety, sociability, talkativeness, not worrying or thinking too much what others might think about you etc. 

What was your dose and the time it took until the effects started kicking in. 

Much love from a young man down on the bottom...!"|1
"hey.. i’m sorry if my english is not that good.. anyways so i’m sad af.. i’ve been reading or researching about depression. i’m very confused about myself and i don’t know myself anymore, but here’s my story.

since at the young age i’ve been always involved with violence and my childhood is very depressing. my parents were very abusive with each other and if i didn’t learn well, my mother used to discipline us with violence that caused my traumas until today. i almost got raped 2 times and such traumatic events that i can’t explain because my brain is very tired to recall them. i think i also have social anxiety. i hate social events because i don’t where to start and i’m scared. mostly i’m oversleeping. sometimes i couldn’t sleep. my appetite changes a lot it’s either i eat a lot or i don’t want to eat. i’m very unmotivated and can’t concentrate anymore. i’m very sad at the point that i want to kill myself because i’m very tired. i think i’m weird too because my mood is very confusing. for example i’m happy and so hyper that i’m very talkative then later i’m very down again. i hate my mood swings."|1
"I have been through some hard shit and I realized that all the pain inside me turned into anger. I wasn’t an angry person at all before but now I am. I get angry very easily. And no one understands because they don’t what you have been through and the reasons for you to be angry. For two years I am in this situation. I never did this but now I am accepting that I’m broken inside. I want to come out from this asap and start enjoying my life again. I want to be so much more stronger than this and never want people to affect me like this again. The biggest thing that I need to work on is loving myself I think. Because I don’t love myself at all. I used to. I’m sure there are lots of people who had been through this and got over it. So Please give me advices to get through this. 

Note: I realized this a long time ago but still couldn’t find an explanation. Why do you think people like to make me angry? Literally every person that I knew even my closest friends do this? When I am not in the mood they like to push me! Is it because my 
lack of confidence maybe?"|1
"I lost my job about 4 months ago, so I’ve been at home without knowing what to do with myself and sinking back into depression ever since. I had my first ever mental breakdown a few days ago, I’m a mess. 

I’ve been feeling the urge to do something creative lately, and I know I’ve always been good with words and writing has been in my mind for as long as I can remember, but I have no inspiration so I’m left with blank pages.
One of the reasons I’m so depressed is that I feel like I took a wrong path. I’ve always felt like I was made to do more of a creative profession but I’ve never trusted myself enough to do anything. I’m only 26 so nothing is too late I guess but I just feel defeated and lost, I wouldn’t know where to start. 

Travelling would help, I’ve travelled alone a lot and it was always helpful but I’m short financially so it’s not really an option.

Do you have any advice on small things I could do ? Something that helped you ? I should probably set up a schedule but I really don’t know what to do with myself, so I get up late to make my days pass quicker, which isn’t the healthiest thing to do."|1
So I've (m23) just started taking anti-depressants to help with my (you guessed it) depression and anxiety. But unfortunately it comes with the side effect that it well, it takes me bloody ages to cum during sex. It already took me awhile just naturally (30 mins- 2 hours average) and now it's just endless, I can get hard and I'm turned on but no big finish. Apparently its quite a common side effect of taking anti-depressants and I was wondering if anyone new of any methods to help with this? (Aside from switching meds and drug holidays).|1

Hi ! since the beginning of 2021 I have some problems with my behavior and thinking I am very resilient and sometimes I think crazy things like that others hear what I think (at first it was not as intense as it is now ) so other than that I'm probably a bit of quarantine I have some symptoms of agoraphobia for example I get stressed when I'm out and this is much more intense when you need to cross a road and wait  to pass the cars. something else very annoying are the ticks I do I basically ticks I did as a child but now they bother me a lot.I have had a tick for the last few months and I say names from inside me that if anyone I remember what I wrote in the beginning to understand how stressful the situation becomes 😄 . So I do not know what to do I do not know if it is something serious or if it is something that will pass over time so if you are a psychologist or something that can help me .....help me 👍|1
most of the time i feel like i’m a failure. i fail at being a good granddaughter, daughter, sister, partner/girlfriend, friend, employee, student.. etc. i feel like i’m a failure at everything.. i feel this huge heavy burden weighing on me. it’s constantly weighing me down and i’m probably going to crumble and break into pieces sooner or later.. leaving the medication alone and having no one beside me at night.. it’s just terrifying.. my mind just goes bonkers, filled with thoughts that might or might not be true...this vicious and endless cycle is going to devour me one day. i just really wish that all these thoughts will come to an end one day. it’s horrifying and mentally draining the way i bring myself down and tear myself into sheds. the entire day i could be normal & just fine, all happy by myself, occupied and distracted by my pets, social media, work or friends & family. But once my mind and being is not distracted by these things, it all comes crashing down. anxiety & overthinking about anything and everything, it’s literally killing me from within, bit by bit, to the point that i can’t sleep at all.. and to not be able to sleep well causes me to stress over it even more. and i end up fucking crying about my overwhelming thoughts? it’s a fucking vicious cycle and i really don’t know what to do about it. probably take the medication (melatonin) to sleep? yeah it works temporarily but what if i don’t wanna be on the medication? then what? the cycle starts again? it’s fucking nuts and fucking insane?! does anyone go through this or am i just insane?|1

I don’t understand how people can live for several decades. How the hell am I supposed to wake up and feed myself and just be alive day after day? It seems impossible. Please give me any advice, I’m so lost and so scared|1
"Hello everyone. I have faced addiction ever since I was 18. Started off with pit and alcohol then after my 3rd son was born I got into opioids. I did a outpatient IOP and when my days were done I picked up weed as soon as I could and the cycle continued for 3 months. My mom knew something was up right away and got me back in rehab inpatient for 5 weeks. This was 2015

I have done pills a couple times since then, but always stopped on my own. Now I have been addicted to ADHD meds and caffeine for 2 years. 

I hate myself and the person I have become. My tollance to ADHD meds is sky rocket so my script only lasts maybe a week.it has also gotten to the point I am not productive either. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 5. Medicated all through school. I know it's not all in my head. I really do suffer with doing every day tasks. 

I tried non stimulant medicine, but it doesn't work. 

Here I am 33 years old, mom to 3 boys. And totally lost in life. I abuse caffeine as well because if I don't I could seriously sleep all day. My just one engery shot, 5 hour, use to keep me up all night. Now I can take 3 and go to sleep. 

No one knows I am struggling but me and the devil himself. My mental health has gone to shit. Depression and anxiety. My entire house is a shit show. I can't seem to get it cleaned up. Mainly because I don't have the energy or focus to do it. Dirty dishes take over my kitchen. no dishwasher so I hate washing. I got behind one week and am now going on a month trying to catch up. 

Laundry is bad, floor needs mopped, everything is a. Shit. Show. But here I am, I got everything under control right? No. I seriously can't go back to rehab. My husband is 18 years older than me, he can't watch my kids. I can't tell my mom because I will just break her heart again. I don't want to watch her cry again knowing I fucked up again. 

My kids sure as hell don't deserve this. I am the scum of the earth. I take care of them and love them to death, but I am failing them. They have no idea how shitty their mom is.

"I’m in the worst mind space that I’ve ever had to suffer and don’t have a clue how I am going to get any better.  Nothing is working, currently on antidepressants which are not doing anything. I have started picking up all my bad habits again. 


Everyone in my life has abandoned me or I have pushed them away which they are better off for. I’m such a worthless person who has no use in life.  All I feel is sadness, too many people have let me down and I cannot cope anymore. 

Someone please help take some of the pain away. I don’t know how much longer I can last."|1

As a sufferer of depression for most of my 36 year in life, I begun to realize it is not just a mental disease but also something that happens on the soul level. The reason I am saying this is that from my experience depression eats away at what makes us humans our drives, our passions, our sense of awe. All those things are experienced beyond the mind and are felt in our core essence. When depression suppress those sensations, it is depressing our souls that otherwise long to expand and experience life but its not able to. What do you think?|1
I legally separated from a really toxic marriage. I never left because I felt like I was the problem. Now that I did leave I just want to have a cuddle buddy someone to come over and bullshit with.

"Hello everyone. 

I'm (M 26) currently fighting one of the most hard battles of my life. A lot of you are with me, I know. This sub is somewhat relaxing and at the same time ennerving to see that so many of us are fighting this frickin monster.

Just a little backstory.

Am a guy that lived in a lot of places throughout life and never felt that I belonged anywhere. At 19 I went to college to pursue music and that went horribly wrong. I gave up after a semester and took a degree in multimedia, while always working with music.

After college I moved to another city to my parents house, and by some luck I found a solid job playing piano. That was until Covid struck. Since January that I am unemployed. Always was a smiling guy, always staying positive through everything, but that ended this year. I don't recognize myself. I barely go out of the bed, or the house. I can't play piano no more. I stand still almost everyday. And I hate this. I want to change it, but I can't. I am doing therapy. But it isn't helping a lot I think.

I feel that my life skills are fading. I barely speak with people since January. My friends are awesome and ask me if I'm doing good. I opened up and said that I was going through a depression and although they understand the depression part, they don't understand why I stay silent. Even I don't understand that. 

I miss me. Nothing makes sense anymore. It feels that I'm afraid of everything. I am thinking about writing this post for at least a month.

I don't think this is an unemployement depression, I think that it goes deeper than that. Suddenly it feels that I won't be able to do any job. Not just music or multimedia, but low entry level jobs.  I'm working on it. 

Have any of you cut relations like this and came back friends afterwards?  I'm afraid of losing everyone that loves me and that I love because of this. 

Have anyone just sunk so bad with depression that life suddenly fled away? Is there a recovery? 

I know there is, but everything is so dark.

**TL DR. Am struggling with depression. I feel that I lost all my skills in life. Please someone tell me that there's a way back.**"|1
I'm on Lexapro 10mg and Inderal 40mg since last one month. Currently having episodes of anger/ mood swings causing difficulty in surviving my job. In think it's time to try an atypical antipsychotic e.g. Risperdal or Abilify etc. Any safe combo of antipsychotic with Lexapro? Advice please|1
"Okay, so I already know I have mental issues. It has been really bad, and the only escape I get is through my music because then I can't think to myself. It has been helpful, but anytime I end up zoning off my mental problems just get so bad. I want to ask for help because I feel that if I don't it will just get worse. However, I have to go to my parents for any sort of help that I need and I feel as though they won't understand, or they will ask a bunch of things that will make me uncomfortable. If I had a regular doctor that I went to I would do something that way, but I don't so I have to rely on my parents for everything. I can't talk to my friends because I feel as though I am a burden to everyone, and it makes me incapable to do things. I realize how much time I waste in their life and realize that I am unimportant, and they have problems that are more important than mine so why bother. I think that I may end up talking to my grandparents because my grandmother has always been someone I look up to in life and she may understand, but I really just want to avoid the ""why do you feel that way"" with anyone I know because I am not 100% sure and I really don't feel comfortable telling people I know that. I also don't want to be asked by my relatives if I am suicidal or self-harm because that will make me feel worse and I don't want to answer that to them. Though if I don't answer any of that I am afraid I won't get the attention I need. If I don't answer my problems will automatically be because of that, ""damn phone"" or ""because of the way I dress"" but in reality, those are some of the things that help me. The way I dress makes me more comfortable with myself and my phone helps with communication and gives me something to do. Overall, I really don't know what to do, or how I can ask for help, so I may be able to improve my mental state."|1
"24 hours in a day is too much.

"It just keeps getting worse


I honestly don’t know if I can keep pushing anymore. I’ve been holding onto a thin rope and I’m sure it’ll break soon. Ive been struggling with my mental health for the longest I can remember. Never went to a doctor because my parents believed the reason why I was feeling the way I feel was because I wasn’t close to god. My parents are strict and barely allow me to do anything. I am about to turn 18 and I’m not allowed to drive, travel on my own, stay at a friends place, hang out with boys , go out with anyone they don’t know, and I have to share my location. The only thing I recently was allowed to do was get a job. I’m going to a community college near me and I am absolutely not looking forward to this. The reason why this was the option I took was mainly my gpa and the fact that I always knew my parents would never let me live on campus esp considering some colleges require that for the first year. My parents are super religious and I am not allowed to wear anything revealing and by revealing I mean shorts, tank tops, swimming suits, and tight fitting clothes(literally leggings). I feel like my life will turn into a living hell once my friends leave for college. We are already growing distant so I know they are going to stop talking to me and I’m going to be alone and miserable. On top of this I’ve been struggling with my weight. I have gained a huge amount of weight and I’ve tried everything to help me lose it but nothing ever works. I can’t look at pictures of myself without wanting to burst into tears. I feel like I’m a fucking failure and I have nothing to look forward to in life anymore. My graduation is next week and I’m considering not attending so I would save myself from the shame. Everyone around me always seems so happy and I can’t understand why not me?"|1
"I've been having these horrible feelings of loneliness for a couple years now but today has to be one of the worst moments I've felt in a long time. I'm a nobody outside of school. I don't really exist outside of it, I'm a school friend and I've realized that that's all I am for the past 6 years. The moment that final bell rings people talk about their plans to go out and have fun together while I just quietly pack my things and go home. Today is my graduation, should be a great day to have fun, drink and look back at the school years fondly yet I am at home studying for my Leaving Cert(state exams) and occasionally scrolling through pictures of classmates and friends enjoying themselves on Instagram/Snapchat. I feel miserable, forgotten, ignored, sad and truth be told it makes me want to disappear or wish for something terrible to happen to me. 

I don't know what to do with myself so going back to the title of this post, how do people deal with their feelings of loneliness?"|1
"I’ve always had serious anxiety and depression. Some years being better than others. I got a DUI in Mississippi recently. I was supposed to start  a fed law enforcement job in July. My DUI, even tho not found guilty yet, made me get kicked out the hiring process.

I’ve been waiting on this job for two years. Been doing law enforcement ( fed security stuff) for like 6 prior. Passed a polygraph- may or may not have lied on everything,and passed btw. That’s how I personally know polys are bs. 

I’m trying my best to stay positive and put things in perspective. I would have been stationed out in the desert in the middle of no where by myself. I currently live on the beach in Florida...

Idk. I’m just going thru it pretty hard rn. Trying not to pick up a drink. May or may not have tried to hurt myself just 6 months ago. I have a son and I feel like he’s the only thing keeping me here. 

I just want to vent I guess. All my friends have basically abandoned me because they know I came out as an alcoholic, and tried to hurt myself. I was about to make 100k a year now at 32 I’m basically broke starting everything over again. 

And. Despite all my pity party bs I realize I’ve been dealt such a lucky hand in life. I’m relatively attractive and healthy, minus when I’m drinking. I grew up and live on the beach. I still have financial support from a emotionally unavailable step father, where my education is always paid for. Starting to go back to finish my bachelors. 

I’ve had some awesome experiences in life. Visited some really cool places. Been with my fair share of beautiful woman. Had financial independence and freedom. 

Seems like when I had the most I was the most out of control and unhappy. 

I ask myself what would make me happy. And idk. I’ve been going to AA since last October and still haven’t got a full time Sponcer. I’m about done doing AA. 

So here I am on the internet rambling. I’m scared of the future. I need a fucking therapist but I can’t afford one. I’m tired of getting back up over and over again. 

Blah."|1
I keep trying to move on and create a better life, but it doesn't seem to work. Do I need to take bigger steps? Change my path? It all feels like blind luck to me, and that's scary.|1
"I’m suffering from the late night blues again, all the emotions I’ve managed to keep at bay throughout the day bubbling up without reason; there is rhyme in how these strong feelings usually occur at this time. Without reason, I have no point to make in writing this. I just have to talk, or else the butterflies in my stomach would burst out with force. This is pure word vomit.

I tend to underestimate how much of an impact anxiety truly has on my days, it hides in plain sight like a master thief. When faced with the sheer prospect of doing anything outside of my comfort zone, this bizarre blend of worry and rage settles in as I bite my fingers and curse, curse and curse. Though I did well in maths today, I had to battle through the frayed nerves, the escapist fidgeting and the strong sense of nausea. It’s such a dull feeling though, something so low-key that it masquerades as depression behind a lie about my laziness and worthlessness. It’ll then bite at my legs and fill my lungs as it prevents me from sleeping, but it won’t reveal itself in the safety of my own home either.  

I’ve evolved from running out of lessons to sleep through the day to sleeping through the day with impunity, simply because I *asked*. It saddens me that the thrill and joy I should be experiencing, of bettering my academics and making new friends and discovering who I truly am, comes from waking up 2/3 of the way through the day and realising I’m close to going home. This is meant to be the time of my life where I *make something of myself*, god damnit, but I’m wasting all my privilege. And it won’t be long until time runs out, either.

The feelings right now are overwhelming, I’m barely keeping myself from falling apart under the torrents. I could cry, but my shitty tear ducts won’t let me. I feel oddly romantic right now. I just want someone to hug, I’m lonely amidst these horrible thoughts and can’t bring myself to cry to anyone. Just feeling this low… wouldn’t that be nice? That comfort, that connection? Living for somebody else? Again, I’ve only realised in the past few months that it’s something I’ve gone without nearly my entire life.

It feels like I’m trapped, sandwiched between whatever the hell is wrong with me and my inability to actually pull myself out of it. Though just for today, I feel like I’ve actually made some semblance of progress with these demons I’m wrestling with. They’re not out for the count, but I did knock 'em down with a pretty mean clothesline. Still feel terrible, but I did something good today.

This still sucks, but it feels nice to get what I feel off my chest without having to tie it into a narrative or something. Feels like it’s a lot longer than it actually is.   
You all have a nice night now, I’m going to bed. Good luck!"|1
It used to feel good to cry, but when I do it now I feel like shit, so helpless. My head hurts so much from sleeping all day and crying is simply exhausting.|1
"I've been suicidal for as long as I can remember.  I'm trying not to be.  I'm trying to take my meds, go to therapy and be ""normal"".   I'm trying to just do what my wife and children need.  I'm trying to be who they deserve.  But I feel like I'm failing at everything still.  I'm 6 years clean off of opiates, 4 years sober from alcohol, and none of it fuckin matters.  I cant make myself believe anyone when they say nice things about me. I cant handle being alone.  I dont know.  I dont know what I want out of posting this.  I cant even bring myself to tell this to my therapist.  Last time I had one, I told her I was there because I wanted to kill either myself or anyone else and I was looking for help.  She told me I was fucked up.  I cant even have sex with my wife because of my past being molested and raped.  I just dont see much of a point anymore."|1
"I'm feeling horrible, 19 years old, and right now I am wasting my time on stupid things..   
These thoughts of ""what am I going to do next"" got into my mind about 2 years ago.  
I would never want to be someone different from who I am. But I've come to realize that, if I keep things going like this.. it's not going to end well.  


Is anyone else feeling like this too? I'm filled with dread.. and I can't talk to the people near me about it."|1

I can’t buy my own car, I will never be able to afford it. I just can’t do anything right. I’m burnt out and tired of living. All I ever do is sit around in my own thoughts , I literally have nothing else to do anymore. I just want to kill myself and end it all.|1

Sorry if this is overreacting or if it’s even unrelated and I’ll take down the post 

So I watched a 2 min animation and at the 1 min mark a character dies, we learn all about them in the first min and they die is a pretty cruel way, for some reason I just feel a heavy pain in my chest and it almost feels like I’m going to cry, this has never happened to me before, I don’t know what’s getting over me, I watched the animation twice 3 days ago and just haven’t felt the same.


It’s weird because I only got to know the character for 1 min just for them to die, I’m probably overreacting and I’m sorry, does anyone know how to care less about a fictional chat?"|1
"Freshman year of high school just passed, I have disappointed everyone in my social circle - likely to be disgraced by anyone who associates with me. 

For context, I was once a highly accoladed student; perfect state test scores, scholastic awards - reaching the level of being awarded scholarships even while being only in middle school at the time. Paired with that, I also had quite a prominence in the indie game development industry. In fact, I was about to release my first title out into the public after months of late-nights and free time solely allotted to make that game into a reality. Even though I was working long hours, I never saw the project as work - but rather found the process of creating it to be very enlightening. For a while, it was the only thing that honestly made me remain optimistic about my future after enduring a mentally abusive relationship with a former lover that put a heavy strain on my self-esteem. Somehow, making this game in a sense cancelled out all the anxiety and mental breakdowns I was enduring throughout the relationship.

This rejuvenated, optimistic and free-spirited attitude that I had with game development would later contribute to what would be my academic purge, for instead of doing assignments, I would go straight to programming, or testing my game up until the wee hours of the morning, often being too tired to even do my assignments once I remember them. 

Having this fall in grades was a stark contrast to what I was used to, and ended up making me very depressed - but even more so to my parents, and as a result, they heavily discouraged me to continue making games.

Though I do not blame them for the series of misfortune events that will later catapult me into making this post as a last resort, my parents distain pulled quite a switch in me. To save whatever academic integrity I had, I took their advice, and dumped game development in order to make more room towards school - or so I though. Instead, rather than using the allotted time to make up missing assignments, I have rather, took on a pattern of reckless behavior. Being promiscuous with older men online, extreme dieting then binging - just acting incredibly disruptive. Those actions has heavily tarnished my academic and professional career, but even more my sanity.

Fast forward a year or so, I am on the edge of failing my classes, have nobody that I consider a true friend, and have essentially nothing to me that I can be proud of. My life right now is a complete inverse of what it once was - a once promising and ambitious future now turned hopeless and desolate.

I never really discussed what’s really going on with me to anybody, mainly out of shame and them not wanting to hang out with me anymore once they find out how much of a “loser” I am compared to before. I tried talking this out with my parents, but they instead dismiss it to me having problems with my attitude, and how it’s “so easy” to fix my situation. I have given up on seeking professional help, since my parents simply cannot afford that option.

TLDR; I was a high-achiever turned failing student and it’s eating away my life. I do not want this year to jeopardize whatever chances I have to achieve my dreams - and the opportunity to finally live a successful life, yet my academic failures have flushed that possibility down the toilet. Knowing that my ways are disruptive towards my future, I do not know why I still cannot seem to do the “right thing.”"|1
"My period was 8 days late this month. I was so scared and depressed. The thought of having a kid and cursing them to suffer like I have was so overwhelming. All I could think of was killing myself because I couldn't handle it. 
I always wanted kids and I love babies but the idea that I would be making my own flesh and blood suffer like this is unbearable. At this point it feels like having bio kids would be so selfish. I have also always wanted to adopt but I always assumed that I would have bio kids as well. But I think I'm going to have to give up on that idea. I want kids but... It just feels so wrong. 
I know having adopted kids would be just as fulfilling as bio kids so that's not the problem. But it feels like I lost another part of me to my depression. It rules over my life and there is nothing I can do to change that. I feel like it will slowly take everything away from me till I have nothing left. Like nothing I feel or want really matters in the end. If I do something I want or feel happy my depression will pull the rug from under me and I will be right back where I started. 
I feel like in the end no matter what I do or how hard I fight my depression will win in the end."|1
I don't understand this feeling. It's like a dull pressure in my head. I thought that it was loneliness but I can't handle talking to people. Maybe I'm just feeling disappointed that I made it through another day.|1
"To cut the chase, I'm just gonna dumb down stuff I'll say.

Moral is, I feel like I should be happier given my circumstances, but am not. I'm not incredible by anu means but I just feel... off. Like, my head is just an empty cavity and just a shell. I'm just there, coming through waves and just kinda vegetating.

Before quarantine I wasn't incredibally social and during quarantine I ran into like, 2 people I knew in 2 occasions and so, kinda mingled and I was like ""damn, people used to live like this before"". Well, I did not. I was mostly ""ok"" though.

I'm a student athlete and quarantine basically demolished most of my sports matches and so. And looking at school, hell, I just can't bring myself up to paint anymore.

Like, even in schoolwork, I paint and, its there, with no soul no nothing, I still pass with aces and even get money from the school for doing so.

I just feel empty, I know my cures but I just dont bring myself up to do anything to patch myself up really.

I don't know why I bothered to even write this stuff all half assed here but, I still did.

I just dont have passion, even if I'm my best self I want the absolute minimal amount of respect from someone I have in my daily life and so, yet theres not even the slightest idea of set thing.

My bipolar disorder is kinda getting worse too, tolarance to people is somehow decreasing.

I know that these phases come and go but, I just kinda... dont even care about death anymore to some extent.

Ever feel so numb that you go ""well, if I'd die at this moment, I wouldn't care""? Thats me for the most part. I just want motivation, cant find it though.

Anyways, I guess thats me, heh, imagine thinking me being so important that I've basically written some completely random things that no one would care about here in the open. I did it soooooo, yeah.

I feel like I feel but, I'm just simply not there. I dont believe in motivation but, I guess now I kinda need it... I dont know where to find it tho.

Anyways, thanks for reading, pumpkin."|1
Never posted here, but here I am with no idea what to do with my life anymore. I’m a student just about to finish my exams and graduate, and I’m not looking forward to any of it. I hate myself. I hate my body, I hate how hairy it is, I hate my height, my weight, my penis, and most of all I hate my personality. It’s literally a brick. It’s like I have no emotion. No matter how much people try to talk to me or socialise I completely cut them out. I have no clue on how to hold a conversation, how to joke around with someone, how to talk to girls as friends or even more. I get told by family and friends that I’m good looking and I should have a girlfriend etc. but they don’t know how I feel inside. All I can think about is either killing myself or working my ass off and get good money, then hopefully someone will accept me. Thankfully I’m graduating into a decent job with lots of job opportunities so hopefully the long hours I do will keep my mind occupied and busy, and keep me from harming myself. Someone please help me.|1
Yesterday I had to bring my gf, the only anchor in my life, to a clinic. She’s the only thing that makes me happy and now even she’s gone. I couldn’t sleep since and just wanna hurt myself. But I try not to so I don’t make shit worse for her. I can’t visit her and only talk on the phone 10 minutes a day. She’s not fine and mainly worried about me and just wants back to me. But now she’s not gonna be able to see me for this week and the next one. I just can’t live without her.|1
"Weed keeps me functioning, keeps me from being a crippled mess all day. Cops found out that I was smoking at my university and kicked me out and because I’m on “probation” with the university, now I don’t have a job either.

Over some fucking weed. Get a life. People are doing worse things than self medicating in their rooms. I hope those cops are fucking happy, I hope housing is fucking happy. I hope everyone can keep just laughing at how much I try and how much life just throws back in my face.

I catch myself plucking her from my legs and arms. Wanting to feel something. In the last three days I was selected by 2 private schools that accepted 30 students each. I chose one of them and it shows that all of my hard work paid of. And all I had to say was ok. Life ws black and became slightly lighter, just enough for me to realise how deep into shit I am. I am fkn 15 and as all of this is happening I am also being hit by rejection everywhere, that nlbeing romance, friendships, athleticism I couldn't care less about a stupifld fkn school. So yeah, apathy (I think that's how it's called) is the worst symptom I think I am getting from depression|1
"I'm writing here just as a coping mechanism because whenever I share my thoughts with someone, whether it be online, I feel much better and I'm too scared to actually tell someone about my mental state face to face so here I am, anonymously, telling you about my total shithole of a life. 

(This includes stuff about suicide) So, when I was 13 I did some things that I regret to this day and they've had and still have a huge impact on my mental health. I didn't really realize the gravity of the situation at that time as I was a kid but after I was about 15-16 I began to understand what I had done and that lead me in a deep hole of anxiety, depression and self-hate and that's when I had  my first experience of self ""harm"". I had a blade in my hand and I was going to slice my other hand but I was too scared to do it. This happened a few times and I decided that I was not going to do it. After that I spent 2 years in my mind and I don't kid when I say ""in my mind"". That was literally what my life was; constantly thinking about the past, thinking about what people think of me, thinking about anything but what was going on around me and because of that I became this awkward person and a shell of myself and naturally because of that I lost all of my friends and never really made any new ones. My life was at the lowest point at 18 and I finally decided to take Amitriptyline( antidepressants) thinking that it would magically solve all my problems and make me forget about the past. I was quite surprised that it was working, atleast at the start, but then I became reliant on it and after about 6 months of use the depression came back. It's crazy how it works: one day you think it's all going good and the next day your brain does some psycho chemical reactions and all of a sudden your life is hell. This one was especially brutal as my dog died in the same period and I think that made it that much worse. This time I had made up my mind that I would OD on Amitriptyline because I thought that the process won't be painful. Fortunately or unfortunately my sister found me vomiting in my room and I was transferred to the emergency room and survived.


I'm 21 now, studying in the United States, away from my family, paying 50k a year for an education I don't understand, with no friends and at the lonliest and lowest point of my life. In short, a total loser of a human being.I didn't have any suicidal thoughts for almost 2 years but right now I really don't see any other way out of this depression."|1
I was supposed to have some drinks with my friends tomorrow but I can not get out of bed so I had to cancel.

" 

I've been facing the common anxiety problem for a long time. These times it has become unbearable.

I feel normal when I open my eyes in the morning. Then, when I think of the things I have to do during the day, anxiety spreads to my body like a shock.

The news I see when I wake up in the morning is usually about the country. And most of it is negative news. I'm worried about my future.

There is no one I can call ""my friend"" in my life. There is actually one, but he is really far away.

I am currently performing my compulsory military duty near the war zone.

It makes me sick to hear gunshots every day and to hear news about the wounded and dead soldiers.

I don't know if it had to be like this

I envy people in safe countries.

I don't think the world is fair."|1
I have been struggling. A lot recently. But if I'm honest I haven't been great for a while but its getting bad enough that I'm struggling to function. I'm at the point where I'm considering looking for professional help but how does it actually help? Like when you go to the doctor most of what they advise is just common sense that you can work out for yourself. Will a mental health professional actually tell me anything I don't know already? Everyone always says that therapy helps but they never say how.|1

Rock bottom implies that there is a definite level where oblivion just stops there and not further. From my own experience no such a thing exist. I think feeling depressed or bad can have an ever growing bottom that does not stop at a limit. Telling this from 36 years with depression and it keeps changing colors, flavor and intensity|1
Not sure what I’m hoping to gain from posting this, but It feels better to get this off my chest even to internet strangers. I really don’t want to exist anymore. I despise myself, I literally cannot stand myself. The way I act, look or talk. I hate waking up everyday and having to live another one. I have tried changing this so much, everything I could do to try and change my mindset I have done. I’m in therapy right now, have been since I was 6 and nothings changed. I’ve had depression for 6 years and I’m only 16. I have tried everything, I’m on my last straws, I keep telling myself I can’t keep doing this, I fucking can’t. But I stay, I fucking stay, for people that treat me like shit just because I don’t want to bother them, and it’s dumb to kill yourself. I don’t want to die, I just don’t want to be here. I don’t have anybody, I don’t have a reason. Im only another depressed kid out of millions, it wouldn’t mattered if i died, but I wouldn’t do it. So all I can do is wait and hope? That it gets better, I’ve been waiting for so long.|1
I've made some horrible decisions in my life and I definitely want to end my life. I've thought extensively about it and I'd like to go out with benzos. Just go to sleep. I'm so extremely sorry for what I have done but it definitely can't be erased. I've caused so much hurt and pain that I honestly can't compute it. I gave up drugs a few years ago but I still kinda know a few people who would help me out. I'm actively trying to contact them but nothing has worked out yet. I just absolutely hate the things I have done and wish I had the nuts to just put a gun to my head. That's the last way I'd do it. But definitely the absolute last. Things definitely don't get better in certain situations. I'm living (for now) proof. Drugs are a terrible idea! Ruined my entire life. Just wanted someone, anyone to know why. That's all.|1
I’m not using a throwaway, I’m not ashamed of this. I think the world is going to end soon. Everyday it just gets so much worse. Things have always been bad but I feel like the last six years have sent the Earth spinning down the fucking drain. We are rapidly hurtling towards our destruction and the only thing we will have to blame is ourselves. This capitalist hell scape will kill us all. Everything has become so toxic, so corrupt, I feel as if the only way to fix it would be to eliminate the corrupt from our world but we have far too little time for that. We are so, so, so fucked. People say that the news only shows the worst of what’s happening, and I agree, but the good that’s been happening recently has been so little and the bad has been so much, I don’t even blame them for only reporting the worst. Every single fucking day some horrid new thing happens. A shooting. A bombing. A new bigoted bill. Another missile strike. More human rights violations. More hatred. More fuel for the ever burning pile of evil. The end is near, and it’s our fault|1
"So... I am in a very bad place right now. I mean - most of us on this subreddit are struggling, right? So I am no different. I am writing this after a huge panic attack and several hours of intense depressive state.
I need an advice right now. 
First of all - trigger warning - I am talking about my mental health, ED, self-harm, etc. If you are at the state of mind where you can't give me advice and my post might trigger you, please skip it. I don't want to hurt anyone and I know I go through topics that are rather unpleasant. 
Also if you need a TL;DR version, I'd rather if you skipped my post altogether, I don't mind if you don't want to read it all, but I don't need a quick tip from someone who for any reason don't have a time or energy for context. If you have a moment for me though, thank you for reading my post. Here it is. 

Among other problems in my life there is this one particular thing I need an advice for. Outside family I don't have anyone. No friends or relationships. I am very very lonely and sometimes it's ok, I isolate myself for many reasons. I got used to being alone and most of the time I enjoy it and I am good at spending time alone, but then there are times when I really need someone. And at those times I try to hold back, because I have a rich past of impulsive friend searching and then ghosting (even very nice people) once I see the other person doesn't understand my need for alone time caused by my depression (then I feel trapped), or once I see the other person doesn't struggle with mental health and they don't get me that well or once I don't feel any connection between us or sometimes for other reasons. (It seems like I need a specific sort of chemistry. When I don't feel that, I can't befriend just anyone easily, even if they are great. I need specific dynamics and connection and I have no desire to push myself into an acquaintance with someone I don't want to explore mentally). Most people are looking for perspective and drama-free relationships and friendships and that isn't sustainable with me, because of my health (both - mental and physical). Whenever I was looking for friendships, I would be very open about my mental health and bad character traits and specific needs in relationship, but it wouldn't help to find a sustainable and interesting friendship. It seemed like people got fascinated by an ad or profile that speaks very openly about those things and don't try to lure people. It standed out and so it caught quite a lot of attention. But it wouldn't help - quite the opposite actually. Last time I tried to find a friend (about 3 years ago), the guy wasn't very honest with me and once we went out he kissed me and pushed my boundaries and I very soon found out he was looking for more than a friend but didn't want to say it in his ad so that if he wouldn't like the girl in real life or wouldn't feel a connection he wouldn't have to hurt the person . I know he was seeing another person too. It sounds much worse than it was, he was actually quite a nice guy, but I was looking for a friend and ... I still get triggered when I remember the kiss, I hated it. So that wasn't fun and since that particular experience I stopped looking for a friend.
I am a very loyal friend once me and the other person manage to get over some period of time and our relationship/friendship gets more intimate or when we find a connection, simply when we bond. My longest friendship lasted 13 years (I am 25 now. We got over puberty together and became adults together, but it ended right before covid unfortunately - it got unbearable, I was working really hard on this relationship and she ended up purposely make me relapse in my bulimic habits and so I ended the friendship, because I wasn't comfortable forgiving her everything, paying all the time, letting her scold me and call me fat and talk shit about my family and basically only doing what she wants, etc.). 
The problem is that at times I can be very distant and I need my space. But other times I am clingy and intense (I even have a platonic crush phase but I don't want anything more, I just feel very fondly about my friends sometimes). And that doesn't mean I don't understand when the other person needs their space when I am more communicative. Not at all - I never get needy. I just need the same kind of honesty I give to others - I need to hear that I am overstepping something or that the person needs space for reasons unrelated to me, but most of my friends were never able to tell me directly. They'd just gradually cut me off. But the two extremes (distant x clingy) make people quickly tired of me. Ironically the clingy state doesn't bother them as much as the alone time - they usually find someone else to spend time with and never let me back close to them once I am ready to pursue our relationship again.
I am bipolar and right now I am mentally unstable (things built up in my life, problems on problems and then some.) And I am trying to work it out, get better, work on myself, become a better and more stable person, but right now? I am nowhere near that, which is the main reason why I chose to isolate myself in the first place. I thought my mental growth and healing will be faster. I thought that I will find friends when I get better and stable so that I don't hurt people by ignoring them (sometimes the alone time means I don't read messages and stop communicating for weeks). I thought it's irresponsible to be looking for a friendship when I am a lot to handle. My mental health is very bad as I said and I didn't want to pull a nice innocent person in my messy life. I thought it would be horrible to find a friend only to worry them and make them care and make them suffer when they see fresh scars on my arms. 
But I am still a person in need of a friend. I need to be understood. I need to be heard. I need to know there is someone who cares, because right now I don't care about myself and I need a motivation. I need someone to be interested in my wellbeing and success. I need acceptance and honestly just chatting with strangers on reddit doesn't solve anything. I need a real person so that I stay motivated.

Ok... this post is a mess. I am sorry for that. But I am almost done, I promise. 

I understand that what I just described is undesirable af. It is a huge responsibility to start willingly a friendship with someone like me. Hell, I'd even argue that the person who would want to befriend me must have bigger issues than I do, if they find it a good idea to become close to me at those conditions. 
So my question is - what would you do? What do you think I should do? Should I overcome my fear of hurting or ghosting people and openly write an ad where I don't hide my current issues? Or should I wait until I am a stable and more responsible person and just overcome my loneliness?
I have no idea.
Thanks if you read this. 
I had a huge panic attack tonight and I had a fight with my mom and I realized I have no one to call when I can't call her and my loneliness got more intense than usually.
Anyways - I'll wrap it up here. If you have an advice for me,  I'll appreciate it. Also sorry for inconsistent writing, as I said - I am not at my manic state, I am going through the depressive part and I wanted to put as much info as I could so that I can get an honest opinion from someone.
I hope you are doing better than me and I wish you the best."|1
"Hi reddit,

I wanted to share my bedtime routine with you and explain why it means so much to me. I'm not writing this to motivate you or show you ""you can do it!"". I just want to acknowledge it to myself.

At around 8-9pm, I start to feel tired. I start by making myself a herbal tea I'll be sipping on throughout. I take my medication (which makes me drowsy, so that helps with sleep). I go back to my room. I put on a YouTube video, either lofi, or one of my favorite youtubers. Maybe melancholic music, depending on my mood. I start cleaning. I take all the dishes I accumulated during the day to the kitchen and wash them, put away the stuff that I moved around, like papers and hobby related stuff. Then I sweep my floor. I make my bed. Now I have a clean room. I put on a night gown, then I brush my teeth, wash/hydrate my face, and I brush my hair. Now I feel clean and pretty. At this point, I gauge how sleepy I am. I might continue watching videos, or read a little, or write a reddit post.

I don't always follow all of the steps. It's hard to motivate myself, but I always complete some of them, and it's the dedication to the routine that counts the most. I look forward to bedtime the entire day. I genuinely feel happy when it's bedtime. It sometimes feels like night time is the only peaceful time I get, no matter how lonely and overwhelmed I feel.

Thank you for listening reddit."|1
So, I'm not here for pity or sympathy or anything I just need some advice from some people who might know what I'm talking about and have some pointers. I am like severely failing school and I know it and it sucks but my mom doesn't understand that it's not that I don't want to do the work, it's more like I just don't have the energy or the motivation to do it. I have tried to explain this to her but she just gets frustrated and doesn't seem to get it. I don't know how to handle that so if anyone could lend me a few tips that would be very appreciated :)|1
"My twin brother was taken from us just moments after we came into this world.

I've spent 40 years since broken and lost.

I'm incomplete.

In recent years I tried to end my life, so we could be together again.

I was wrong to do it.

The truth is Michael died, so I could live.

His sacrifice gave me a chance.

My life now is trying to make others feel worthy and hopeful.

What's your anchor or tether to this world?

I'm sorry Michael. I will live for you for as long as I can. I promise."|1
"I've been constantly having thoughts of wanting to kill myself or harm myself, and my anxiety is just making me not want to ask for help, because I may be seen as ""rude"" or ""attention-seeking."" I'm also anxious about typing this post. These thoughts are extremely overwhelming, and it makes me suffer in silence.  


When I do try to break out of my suicidal thoughts by watching a tv show or something, I eventually get sensitive and anything that's slightly negative, can put me right back into being suicidal. When I am suicidal, I don't want to get help because I feel like a complete piece of shit, and when I do try to get help, I always retract what I am saying (e.g. I'm about to type a long wall of text about my depression to a friend, then I delete it thinking that I'm being selfish.)  


It doesn't help that my parents criticise me all the time, about my bad sleep schedule, about me being negative all the time."|1
i only tried drugs 2 times and in both times i felt happy or i was always smiling , i know people say its addicting but if the price of a short moment happiness is a life time addiction i dont mind , cause i dont remember the last time i smiled|1

"M/17.Hello, this is a throw away account because I have huge anxiety and im having a panik attack rn (and I dont want anyone I know to see this).
An hour ago my friend posted a screenshot in our groupchat that proved a lie I told my friends a few times wrong. (I know lying is terrible but sometimes I just cant get myself to tell the truth and I use lies to boost my ego :/ ) The lie wasnt really big and I didnt hurt or insulted anyone with it, it was just to boost my ego. I didnt take another look in our groupchat since then because I know they are all calling me a liar (which I am) and stuff like cringe etc. Im afraid they will laugh about me forever now and that they wont spend time with me online anymore.
Im feeling depressed since like 2017 but since summer 2020 I have suicidal thoughts everynow and then and I already set myself a date for suicide if I wont enjoy my life till then. But now that the only friends I have are hating me right now and calling me cringe Im afraid I will do sooner then the set date."|1
"It's like week 8 of the quarter and I have nothing to show for it. Every day comes and goes and I think about killing myself. I've completed like 2% of all the work necessary for this quarter. I'm on edge and can't focus. I only started medication two days ago, and I can't imagine making any significant progress before the quarter is over. I'm too afraid to reach out for help. I'm afraid of the judgment that is sure to come, and I'm afraid of the consequences. I'm considering withdrawing, and it puts a strain on my relationship. 

I can't work on myself if I can't be alone with my thoughts."|1
All I do is inflict myself upon people. I am disgusting. I don’t deserve to live. Others don’t deserve the displeasure of interacting with me. I am a waste of food. I hate myself so fucking much.|1
I really can't handle my mind. I always feel judged. I can't casually socialize or talk to my workmates comfortably. We're usually three people in the office and I feel like as a new employee I'm making the place or environment awkward for all of us because I never talk much. Although I want to loosen up but I really don't have something to say. I'm a late bloomer, I don't have any life experiences or any legit passion that I can share or talk for hours 😭 I'm also not good at joking. It's stressing me out because it happens daily.. A lot of times I just want to be absent at work because of the awkwardness and quietness. This afternoon, my manager was talking to my other two workmates, I was inside another area, I know that they know I'm hearing them. My manager shared a story about this employee that he knows who was accustomed to office jobs that he barely talks and just do his job, he said this kind of guy isn't really friendly, cannot tell story to just atleast make friends and build connection with everyone. Although I know it's not me, but I felt that my manager was sharing it because he thinks I'm also like that guys that he was talking about. I really want to feel at ease with any social interactions.. To add up, my workmates are really kind and they aren't ignoring me, I feel like they are actually letting me to open up and befriend them. But as time passes by, I don't know why my mind really works this way. I think it's because I was bullied when I was young, I was always taken advantage of, I'm also extremely shy since I was a child. I don't have any opinions on any matter or any social issues. Although I love to get many information about the world, I just became an information-hoarder resulting to me not remembering them. I don't have any life experiences that I can share with others, I'm not privileged enough to go out and experience the pleasant things in the world like gimmicks or something enjoyable. I'm kind and really nice and really I want to build connection. I'm responsible with my work but others are perceiving me as arrogant, unfriendly or rude because I don't talk to them. They do not know that I'm just shy and cannot think of anything to say 😭|1
"I was crying on my way to work at this place where I volunteer, (because covid, place has no money, hope to get retained there), because I'm so broke right now

So I said to myself,I'll spend the day looking for jobs and also get on it when I get back home.

When I got home, I did nothing, I cried a little about something I don't even remember, then I think I just continued watching tik Tok.

I feel like I spend the whole day worrying about money and that's tiring so how will I find energy to find work.

I used to think doing nice things for myself and my girlfriend would motivate me enough but here I am. I just want to die, I can't wait to leave here. Everything is so tiring 

They are threatening another lockdown here so it will be even harder to find work and I'm just so discouraged.

Last year when there was a lockdown here it was a very hard time for us because my parents were stuck in another country for six months and I could go on .... Like when will it get better? 🥲"|1
"Well...

Unless I want to have cops banging on my door for a “wellness check”.

Unless I want to risk losing my job, which is the one good thing I have going for myself right now.

Unless I want to be put in a hospital where some hack psychologist will “assess” me, prescribe me trash drugs that will just render me useless for a few hours and then release me back into the wild after I play their dumbass game long enough to “win”. (Been there, done that as a teen)

It’s so fucking disgusting."|1
I have been off late feeling some kind of lowness on certain days at random times of the day. It is not consistent. It just happens here and there. I have never felt this before. This has been something new for me. I do not want to get on any pills. I hate the idea of it. Getting on pills to feel better... I don’t wanna go that route as yet. Any suggestions how i can tackle this situation?|1
I'm failing all my classes in school. I'm in highschool. At this point I don't think I'll even graduate. The only class that's has an A is PE and the rest are at 60s-50s.

"And she mentioned how he “hates her and his whole family” and I got upset and stormed out of the room because she says that shit about both my brother and I all the fucking time. She chased after me and started chewing me out because I had made a few comments trying to defuse the situation a bit by helping to explain/translate things my brother had said, and that upset her for whatever reason. I said something along the lines of “It seems to me that it’s you who hates us and you’re just projecting that onto us.” Her reply was “well I guess it’s mutual then.”

I’ve dealt with depression and self worth issues since I was about 12 years old (that’s when I recognized it anyway), I assume it stems from my Dad not being around and not making an effort to be in my life but idk for sure. I’ve gotten much much better in the last few years, but things like this make it hard."|1

"I have anxiety but i can control it and function pretty well but sometimes it gets out of hand. Whenever that happens, I could sense the build up so I ask my wife to give me space. 

Today, I asked her 3-4 times in a space of 2 minutes but she wouldn’t stop. She knows about it because i have told her many times that I need my space in these situations. 

I shouted 4 words “ S T F U” once .. my daughter started crying.. I absolutely hate myself now and everything around me. 

I am wrong in what I did but i feel helpless in controlling it after a certain threshold. I feel like removing myself from their lives to protect them now...

I don’t know what to do."|1

I'm genuinely tired of living, I have nothing to look forward to. Every day I wake up, go to work, go back home and go to sleep. I'm not excited about anything anymore, my stomach hurts constantly and I just want everything to change, but have no energy to actually change anything. I've been on antidepressants for the past seven years and sure, I can see that I'm better than I was in high school, but everything's too much and not enough at the same time. I don't know where to start, where to begin with changing my life for better. Do you have any advice?|1
"I just read about Clomipramine and thought about it as as next medication for my depression and social anxiety as all the SSRIs, SNRIs, Moclobemide (MAOI), Amitriptyline (tricyclic), neuroleptics, opipramol etc didn‘t work at all for me. Nada, zero. I also did 2 depth psychological therapies already and am in a behavioral therapy at the moment. No help, no success. No symptom reduction.

Has anyone of you experience with Clomipramine?

1. What was your dose and for how long did you take it? How much time does it take until it starts working / showing significant effects?

2. What did the effects feel like? How did it affect mood, anxiety, motivation/energy, sociability, talkativeness and so on? I‘m especially interested in the social anxiety part (sociability, talkativeness, extroversion, joy to hang up with ppl, not thinking about what others might think about you etc) as my social anxiety is the biggest source of my depression.

3. Would you say, Clomipramine might be potentially effective for my issues depression and social anxiety - EVEN IF I tried all the SSRIs, SNRIs, opipramol, moclobemide, amitriptyline and neuroleptics? How does clomipramine differ from all the typical serotonergics and other ADs I already tried...?

4. Anyone here who finds that Clomipramine acts very different or stronger than other antidepressants you tried?

5. Anyone who was therapy-resistant like me and finally had success with Clomipramine?

I know trying out Clomipramine would be the best solution for finding out but since I read all those horror stories about PSSD (post SSRI sexual dysfunction) that can be permanent I am so horribly afraid of getting this too and am just lucky that I never ever got PSSD from all those countless ADs I already tried. Knowing about this gives me so much anxiety and worries, almost 100% killing my will to try another antidepressant again (especially as I already tried so many without any success)."|1
"I want to commit suicide already but I don’t even have the energy, drive, or conviction to even do -that-. Absolute misery and torture, this is. Terrible. 

Yet another thing I can properly describe, label or do justice to how it is—the feeling of it. What it’s like to live and exist this way. And to explain why you want to do such a thing, to willing helpers, over and over and over, never coming closer to being truly understood or truly helped, cared for, appreciated and loved. Repeating. Losing more spirit and connection to this world or existence."|1
It feels like no matter how much self improvement I do its not enough. I never fully feel satisfied I got a clean diet I almost never drink I got rid of caffeine I do cardio and strength training i meditate I feel like I do as much as I can but its never enough it's just a temporary distraction my condition never gets better the outcomes of my life don't change the void doesn't heal those who said it helps with depressive episodes are liars|1
"ever since i can remember i hated my life. My mom is the worst person ever she makes me miserable she calls me stupid,ugly,pig,useless,lazy and more every time she sees me .and she even attacks me when i didn't do anything! i hate my home so much, i never relax because i have to do all the chores like a slave im still in high school and its really hard i have to stay up late to do my assignments and, my mom says i have to get high grades or shes gonna kick me out and attak me and its really hard shes always yelling at my dad until early in the morning and i cant sleep. to make it worse one of my siblings are constantly making up lies about me so i get in trouble and whenever im crying or sad or having a breakdown my other two siblings tell me stuff like ""whats wrong with you why cant you act normal stop being stupid"". i just cant take it anymore i have no where to go and i have no freedom i just need one day to feel better just one day without being miserable."|1
Everyone just ghosts me anyway. Why bother making friends when they'll eventually just turn their backs on me?|1

"Does anyone else not like people?

Like I have a loving a supportive family, and we hang out and get drunk and play games and get along well enough but I only participate because they are my family. If I met any of them in my life as friends, I would not chose to spend time with them. I don't like them as people. Hanging out out for little chunks of time is fine but any longer weekend hangouts I just get sick of them.

I feel the same way about my chosen friends, and my partner. Like, we all met in college and one way or another we ended up being roommates and staying in touch. It's not just that hanging out with one person for a long time you naturally get annoyed with their little habits, it's more like when I really think about it I just don't genuinely like a single person. I keep people around because I guess I would be lonely without them but idk...

Honestly, I don't even like myself.

now im just kind of thinking why the fuck should i try even living? everything seems like a chore and school feels more like unpaid work. and my generation is absolutely fucked. what the fuck should we do against climate change, wars, etc. i just dislike seeing “by 2050 a billion species will be extinct” everyday. it feels so fucking unmotivating when i kinda feel good about myself and then realise my life is meaningless and i cannot do anything."|1

Even my dopiest pot smoking wake and bake frie- aquaintainces have a quicker wit and common sense than I do. Even they are smarter and more knowledgeable than I am. Quicker to draw conclusions. Quicker to find solutions. Better solutions than I could come up with, with more sound reasoning behind them. Nothing I do has a reason for it. There is never a higher purpose or goal in mind. My mind is imprisoned by social anxiety and depression. I have been wondering for the past hour or so, why do I even try? Why live at all anymore? Everything I do, everything I say, everything about me, is based on trying to find validation for my fucking ego because... I don't fucking know. I don't understand why I'm fucking like this. Why I've always been like this. All I know is I am alone, unintelligent, uncurious, with no sense of humor, an inability to accept things the way they are and find happiness, an inability to socialize properly, and a completely barren, hopeless, perpetually unfulfilled sexual desire that my stupid lizard brain cannot stop ruminating about. Why do I even try anymore. I'm not able to socialize and have normal conversations so why the fuck should I keep trying. I just embarrass mysey every fucking day and I'm simply not smart enough to engage people and connect with them. I will always be alone.|1
Any advice on medications that worked for you? Any to try to avoid? I finally moved on from my ex and am happier and ready to finally address my MDD.

"I’m 18 & I turn 19 in a few months. I’m a college student, on the pre-health route, honor roll with straight A’s, volunteer with kids and work fulltime. Perfect life? Not at all. 
Deep down, I’m the most depressed I’ve been in years. It started around 6th grade, so roughly 7 years ago. It got a bit better once I was a freshman in high school, but these past weeks have been absolutely dreadful. I can barely eat, get out of bed or perform basic functions. This is exactly how I was 7 years ago and I do not want to go back. I’m not sure if I can even get help: my mom thinks people who have depression/suicidal thoughts, etc. are “crazy.” & doesn’t agree with medication or therapy. Ironic coming from someone who works in healthcare. I’m also on her insurance, so it’s not like I can get the treatment I need unless I pay out of pocket which is impossible, since I can barely afford to pay for college. I can’t afford to live in the city I go to college in and in all honesty, I can’t even afford my college. I can’t get loans, because both of my parents are financially unstable as they have always been. I have no one to turn to. I unfortunately rely on men for my slight bit of happiness, but I keep getting ghosted/left and I’m over it all. I’ve never seriously considered suicide until now. I don’t see a future for myself at all. I’m terrified of my mind."|1

Except on weekends when i have to hangout with the boyfie. I don’t want to be a loser anymore 😭 but all i want to do is lay down and sleep because I’m malnourished and underweight. I don’t want to live like this anymore.|1
Or both go along ?|1
I was so happy once. What the fuck happened? Where did it go wrong?|1
"This has affected my mood so I'm just going to rant about it:
I've had a really good day until now, I woke up feeling pretty good, I got some jobs done; I spoke to my therapist and then I went out for dinner with my friend. We stayed there for a bit and then had a few drinks then I came home and watched Thor 3. My housemate then came home and stormed into the lounge and cleaned my mess up even though I would of done it, she then asked if I fed the hamsters I said not yet, she then fed them and had a cigarette, she then came into the lounge and said ""right I'm going to bed, see you on Sunday"" (I'm away for the next couple days) she then slammed the door and then immediately phoned someone and was chatting away to them in her room. What did I do? I did nothing to upset her and I feel like I've been completely blamed for something. It stressed me out so much that I slashed the fuck out of my leg and now I feel like there is no point in having friends if this is what's going to happen, I might aswell disappear"|1
"I don't know why. I thought that maybe if I hurt myself enough I'll shut up about the things that's bothering me and making me upset. I thought maybe if I hurt myself I wouldn't be a bitch to my partner and have him get upset at me again. 

I get so upset every goddamn month. And I know the exact reason why. But I don't want to accept the fact that I'm not deeply loved. I just want to hide it with excuses like sex and pet names as my only source of affection. And I know I need more than that. I deserved more than that. But I don't want to accept reality as it is."|1
"I was tired both physically and mentally for years.

I live my normal life from outside, there is nothing to complain about. But last night I realized that I haven't enjoyed anything in my life for years. Nothing I do doesn't satisfy me, it leaves an empty feeling, as if it would be the same if  if didn't do what I did.

I don't know if it's normal to feel this way or if I'm just spoiled.

Maybe I've never been through hard things and can't appreciate my life. I don't know if I have the right to complain, but this feeling never leaves me. It's like I'm guilty and not trying hard enough.

 I remember being a really enthusiastic and lively kid. But now I feel like I'm losing this race."|1
I know I am and other people know I am. Most other people have this insane mental capacity, an ability to remember things, I have the smallest sponge for a brain and it's so depressing, I've never achieved anything in my life because I'm not smart enough, I'm not an expert in anything I can't do anything that feels remotely good enough, I'm just a fool with nothing to talk about and nothing to bring to the table.|1
"Hi everyone, I'm soon to be 19 years old 
My whole life I have not accomplished anything and have failed at everything

I have failed my final exam for elementary and had to stay for another year

Now I have just finish my highschool final exam and 100% I'm going to fail

In my country my final exam called SPM, u need to atleast get a C for Malay language and Sejarah ( history )

I'm bad at languages I have failed The Malay language in my entire life, and also in elementary I took Chinese lesson I also failed all of the exam that's in Chinese and Malay

I took extra class, study, speak that language and learn technique but no matter how hard I try I failed. Any languages I try to learn it doesn't go into my head 

When I was young, around 7-10ish in elementary school i stole a Lego robotic set. I was caught and got scolded badly by my father first time in my life
It was one of the worst memory that still stick with me throughout my life and always appear when I'm depressed

in my highschool years I cheated in my exam over and over because I have been trying for 9 years yet my Malay languages isn't improving so I started cheating in my exam in my final two years in highschool. I was caught and got embarrassed and got scolded by my teachers

I know what I did is totally wrong, then why did I do it? Truth is I don't know why I did it. Worst of all I already knew this would happen and I also know that cheating won't benefit me in any way. Also I tend to lie alot in my life, it has di e down alot but once in awhile I still do.

Now that highschool is finish and now waiting for the result of the final exam, I have been depressed for 4 years snd is building up and the space of hope is getting narrower. When the government announce the date of the final exam result I will drink two bottle of cough syrup . I have already attempt suicide 5 times, the worst one was an overdose of paracetamol, painkiller and random medicine 20-30+ in 20min. I felt Ill and nauseous for 2 weeks,I was hoping to passed away in my sleep but I only felt tired and no appetite. Second worst one is either drinking 6 litre of water in an hour or drinking a quarter of hair tonic bottle, I could go on because I vommited and it burned my throat. So on so forth

I have no interest in studying anymore, I'm not good at that. Everyone been pressuring me to get an A even though I can't get a C. My family doesn't have much money and is very strict, my father doesn't allow me to work, study first. I know that I will work a minimum wage job and I know he cares about me

The only upside about me is that I like to try things and get the experience, I tried many things from coding, stock, drop shipping, making my own face cream, cooking, farming, exercise etc. I'm more interested in those type of things than studying but I know none of those things matter if I don't have any capital so to get capital I need a job or win lottery somehow. Also I like writing suicide notes :(

I'm an idiot I know that, guy that can't even passed my highschool exam. Guy that doesn't learn from previous mistake. 

I've been suicidal this year because everything is going downhill. I have just started stock trading recently with 800 dollar and I have lost 500 dollar already. Last month I was able to make atleast 20dollar perday for 2week for  now I have been losing 20 dollar a day around that amount. My family having less money, my sister have college dept, I know that I won't passed my highschool now I'm just waiting for the announcement of the result.

I have never been this depressed before In my life, everything anything I do it doesn't seem to have any result anymore, dropship can't make a single money,, I don't have any motivation to code forgetting every thing about it, trading now left with 280 dollar. 

Knowing that I can't do anything and I have been a disappointment in my life, I think is better if I'm not here I won't be able to accomplish anything

I stopped exercise because Everytime I do, all the bad memories keep appearing out in my head. Making me less motivated to exercise

I lost so much money in stock now I'm even more scared to put any amount in it

I can't work right now because my father don't allow and is covid . I don't even know if I can get a job at all.

I have been a failure in my life 
I tried changing but I didn't get any result
I don't know if I have any mental illness like dyslexia so that's why I can't seem to learn any languages but it doesn't matter anymore

I can't seem to be able to do anything
I've been so depressed I just want to sleep all day. 
My dreams have become more lucid I feel nice in my dream.

I want to call suicidal hotline but I'm worried that the police will be involved 

I'm a failure in everything whatever I do or touch it break apart

I been crying everyday, I tried improving myself
I'm not stable I been in my room lying down looking at stock all day but whenever I see a 1 percent loss I get even more scared
I don't want to do anything anymore I'm too afraid
I'm very close too suicide


Please help I really don't know what to do with my life anymore
I can't do this
I'm just holding onto a small thin string the moment they announce when final exam result will bethe string will snap
I don't want to see my result and I don't want to go through failing and disappointment look from my family
Before the exam my family told me you better passed, now that I know I won't I really don't want to see that day coming
Do I still want to live 98% no
I'm not as strong as last year I can still handle few losses and failure 
But now everything just collapse Im in gear of losing I'm in fear of embarrassment im in fear of failure and not being able to accomplish anything

Before my depression was this strong I always told myself to be successful is not a straight road there will be up and down and you may fail many time before u succeed. 

I stick by it until I finish my final exam 
Now My past bad memories has been appearing in my Head every second I can't stop thinking about it knowing how much of an idiot and failure I am
I have not finished anything I have not gained a single thing.

I can't do it anymore :(
Nothing is being done I'm not learning anything now
I'm learning useless thing now like saying ABCD in opposite way ZYX

I used to be someone who likes learning new things everyday but now it just stopped because I know that my suicide date is nearing everything seems useless and I couldn't get anything accomplish"|1
"My Depression is coming back and i dont know what to do.

For the past 5 month my mental health was better then never before and now i'm sitting crying in my room and i think about death.

i dont want to be Depressed but it seems that every single time im finally happy with something it gets me again and drags me down.

I already going to Therapy and i think im sleeping  enough.

Every single day im saying myself that im a fukcing nobody and hat nobody would care if i kill myself but in the back of my head i know that when i was gone many People would be very sad.

i dont know what to do.

Sorry for my bad english..

Thanks for reading."|1
I know it may sound extreme but yeah...it's gonna happen eventually. When it happens life on earth will end too. What do you think about this? Like...all art, music, movies, science, history, everything will, in time, disappear. I know I have depression but that just made me even more depressed.|1
"I don't know if this is an official term or has ever been coined before. I don't mean normal boredom, because I can be psychologically occupied (not bored) whilst still feeling emotionally bored. **I MEAN THIS PERSISTENT FEELING OF ""BLEH""/""UGH"" DURING NORMAL WAKING CONSCIOUSNESS.** The only time I ever feel emotionally entertained is when I'm dreaming (extremely vivid and intense emotions) or am drunk (I haven't tried other consciousness-altering vices and I don't want to).  Like, I mean I genuinely think that in order for the brain to function normally, you have to be in this unemotional, sober and alert state.

I sometimes get glimmers of relief when playing an immersive game/watching an incredible movie/listening to really good music etc., but they only last for a few moments before I'm grounded in reality again.

Am I making sense? You guys know what I mean?"|1
As the title says. Sertraline (Zoloft) has been really good for me - but in the past 2 or 3 months I’ve found it to begin to lose its effects. Also seemed to cause ED and loss of sex drive/performance anxiety blah blah. All of those things. But for people with anxiety as well as depression symptoms sertraline is awesome.|1
My mom got hip replacement surgery last friday and asked if I could stay with her for her two-three week recovery since she can't rely on my sister. I've been staying with her for a week and my mental health plummeted. I'm a sophomore in college and I had just finished staying at my apartment and moved in with this family that I've known for forever before staying with my mom for her recovery. The family I was staying with were very kind and I took care of their kids. The kids miss me a lot and I miss them too. Now the problem at hand is that since I've stayed with my mom I've endured emotional/verbal abuse constantly. She has blamed everything that she can't do my problem and recently I've found myself more suicidal since I've been here. I understand she's incompetent and frustrated about it currently but she's not at all thankful that I am taking time out of my work schedule to work here. I don't know how much longer I can endure this abuse anymore. Since I moved out straight from highschool and had a lot of freedom since then I don't know how I used to respond to her abuse. Every day seems to get me more and more degraded. I don't know if I'll be able to come back from this or be how I used to be.|1
"

I’ve been in school for 13 years I went back to get my diploma but right now because of where I live and because of the income my family is making I don’t see a need to still go to school. I feel like I need to be working 8 full time jobs just to get ONE bill payed. I fucking hate it. I try to hide it so so fucking much but it’s coming to a point where I can’t anymore And I’m ready to break down infront of everyone. And I can’t even explain it when someone asks me If I’m okay I don’t know what to say."|1
"Hello. I’ve been dealing with depression for about 12 years now. And this year is my first year in about 10 back on medication. The first med after a couple that I stayed on for the longest felt to make me better, but I told my psych that soon after I was happy but only when I was doing impulsive things to keep me happy. Then he put me on a mood stabilizer. 

Fast forward I’m on Zoloft, Lamactil, Remeron, and Adderall. 

I’ve been seeing joke tiktoks about ‘when your dr puts you on an anti depression without knowing you’re bipolar and you need a mood stabilizer because you’re sent into mania’

He never stated bipolar. Or BPD when meds were discussed. I only realized this soon and my next apt isn’t for a month so I’ll ask him then but just kinda curious on what you guys know or think?

I don’t have a therapist that I see in between. Just my psych that I found over quarantine and it’s been about 9 months now and we still just continue the phone call check ins. 

Thanks for reading"|1
"Hey! 

I’ve had clinically-diagnosed depression for a number of years. I’m being treated for it, mostly seems to be helping. 

That said, even with medication taken on a regular basis, I have these days where colors are just dull. I know they’re supposed to be bright and vibrant, but they’re so muted. 

I grew up around nature. I love it! Love to hike, backpack, the works. 

I try to get out of the house and walk/cycle to be a part of nature in the free time I have. On my bad days, the exercise is physiologically good for me… but my emotional state is untouched. 

My neighborhood is absolutely rife with mature trees. They’re gorgeous. On good days, they’re so deeply colored in my vision and perception that I feel like I’m in a painting. On days like I’ve had for the past few weeks, they’re so unsaturated that I wonder if I’m in a black and white photograph. Really. 

Just curious about this (to me… relative newcomer to dealing with my psychological issues) phenomenon regarding the colors of things that I know are differently colored. 

Any and all comments are appreciated. :)"|1

"Hi, it's me again. After opening to my mom about my mental struggling she convinced me to seek professional help. We can't afford it, so i'm going for the public healthcare. I talked to a social worker and she sent me to a psychologist. I had my first talk with her today and will be returning next week. But ever since i opened myself to my mom and other people about my problems, i started feeling slightly better and worse at the same time. I started thinking i might be faking depression. Perhaps i'm just whiny and lazy? Maybe i shouldn't complain about life when others had worse? I know many of my problems are my own making. Yes i had and still have some suicide ideation for years, but never acted upon it.

How do i know if i'm really have some mental problem and not faking it?"|1
All my friends are leaving me, even tho I've known them for years. Everyone hates me at my school due to lies being spread by people. No matter what I do I'm seen as a horrible person and should kill myself. I cannot get support from teachers, as they would conduct an investigation and because everyone says it's true, I would get expelled. I'm fucking done with life and tired of living|1
I can’t be the only one who really mf hate one of my parents especially my mom she always got something to say about trying to tell me how I am when she basically doesn’t even know me fr, she doesn’t even know the most simplest things about me? How she gon tell me how I am and she just doesn’t understand why I can’t go nowhere it’s cause my body is weak and I’m so tired I just can’t go to stuff like my dentist and shii. I hate when people tryna tell me who I am even if it’s my parents cause they only see one version of me|1
What do you do when life isn’t for you?|1
"I can never sleep, life is stressful

I mixed some mommy juice with my cranberry juice. 

Makes this shit so much nicer. 

Never slept last night but I’ve been baking with my nieces and we’re having a good time

I’m not irresponsible or fucked up, just having a good day. Nice change of pace"|1
"Personally the meaning of life is real love but either way I am sure I won't achieve it. I mean why go on if I can't fulfill my only reason for living? Why should I continue going to school for 15 years and then go to work for the rest of my fucking life? I am already damn miserable and I've lost interest in virtually everything. Games bore me, traveling bores me, people bore (and anger) me, everything bores me, nothing gives me the joy I need. There is nothing left. I honestly feel like I'm a husk of a human. More and more mental illnesses took a toll on me and squeezed pointless tears out of me from all the irritation bottled up in me everyday. When stepping out of school I immediately break down on my way home, I don't understand my feelings, I feel awful. I feel like I don't belong with all the social people having fun there while I'm suffering hoping someone, anyone will reach out to me. Even if they did, I would push the offer away wouldn't I? I feel like everyone's judging me but I tell myself ""In the end, our paths will separate right?"" yes, so what? I'll meet newer and newer people doing the same until my death. I feel like I'm going insane. I want to be isolated from everything. No, it's not a phase nor puberty mood swings. I never thought it was possible for me who used to be a happy child to have suicidal thoughts (not exactly, I'm just imagining scenarios of whether that would be better for me or not, I never actually contemplated doing it) just a few years later. I'm in disbelief of what has become of me, I'm no longer a real person. I want to speak about my problems with anyone but all I've received is being brought down and having my problems be used against me. I am so sick and tired of everything and scaring me about the future is no better. There is no future for me. Why would you think there is? I don't even know if I should care. This may sound stupid but my attachment to the theory of reincarnation has made me even more careless. It doesn't matter if I die in the form I am right now, why would it matter? Dying would just make it all better. Consider this, I'm a sad empty shell with essentially nothing to live for. I have no social skills to be with anyone, even if I somehow end up with someone I know it's temporary and I hate it. Either way, I am not scared of dying but I'm scared of \*dying\*. And this shell is unfortunately capable of thinking. I think and that is bad, I don't want to think, I want to live life with a different mindset, a different point of view. Even if what I believe in isn't ""true"" it still works the same. You can't remember anything after death. Even if there's nothing after (which I doubt for some reason) you still won't remember all the troubles and stuff. But if reincarnation exists then you'll live a different life, it doesn't matter as who or what, you won't remember your past life. At all. I'm scared of dying because I don't want to abandon my ""progress"" which is the mindset I have built, despite all my troubles I love the way I think compared to other people. I'm scared I'll get reincarnated as a person consumed by their own delusions without being aware of it. It's what scares me the most, at some point, in some life it will inevitably happen but what happens after now is what I'm most afraid of. Nothing is really inevitable. Either way shit will happen, maybe in a damned googolplex of years but it will happen, that's why I gave up most of my hopes. What if I don't do something now if I won't remember anything I did anyway? Nothing really matters, does it?"|1
"I just posted the other day about how horrible I feel. I thought writing it out, even if it is short, would make me feel better. But it didn’t.

What is wrong with me? By all accounts, I should be happy. I have no reason to be depressed. I’m on medication. I have a happy relationship. I have no real issues besides stress over uni. And yet I’m so fucking unhappy. Unhappy with myself. I'm not good enough. I'm weak. I'm pathetic.

I don’t like dwelling on my thoughts. They race through my head until it feels like someone is screaming, nonstop. And every now and then, the thoughts whisper that I’m better off dead. I’m not actively suicidal, I just wish I didn’t exist. How am I supposed to convey this to my boyfriend? It would break him to know things are this bad again. Most of the time I’m okay, but then, out of nowhere, the insecurities hit. Everyone has them, I get it, I just wish it wouldn’t consume me the way they do. It’s ridiculous, I’m insecure even though he’s never given me a reason to feel this way. But this is not a relationship subreddit. I just need to tell *someone*, I guess.

I try to write my depression and intrusive thoughts away. It helps sometimes. But times like now I just wish I was nothing at all. Is that so bad?"|1
"Hi, I've been rised by abusive parents. I'm leaving them very soon, and my  mental wellbeing is much better than it used to be.  Unfortunately, what  I do keep struggling with is a poignant need for affection that I cannot find a way to fulfill. The  emotional neglect and lack of protection is taking its toll. It's not  that I fell unlovable or something (I heard that many people struggle  with that), I'm also not lonely - I have a few really close friends. But  quite often I feel deeply sad and vulnerable and miss having a safe  home. This gets especially painful when, for example,  I'm coming back  to my place having spent time with a friend and their parents or when  I'm dealing with something difficult that ""proper"" parents whould help  me. I plan on going to therapy as soon as I'm able to afford it, but  what can I do in the meantime to feel better? Talking to a friend or basic relaxation  techniques or are not helpful. Thanks in advance."|1
I waited for years. Hoping things would get better but it didn't. If anything things got worse. I waited long enough and now my patience is running out. I don't know how long till I try to take my own life again|1
"It was nice while it lasted. I dont feel nearly as depressed as I did before. Idek if depressed is the right word. I've been feeling so existential and consumed with the concept of death and dying. Life feels so short but so long and I'm uncomfortable with both right now. I just finished my bachelors and have to apply for a masters program and dont feel worthy/dont know what I want anymore. 

I feel very uncomfortable in my existence recently and I dont like it."|1
"I feel like I am dying on the inside. I can't relax anymore. My life just consists of this depression bubble,and I am just so tired. I want to enjoy things again. I want to be content with my life, but I can't heal anymore, and my parents refuse to send me to a therapist. I hate the way I am living right now. I hate university, I hate the way my mum treats me, I hate that I can't enjoy anymore. I am just so tired. I miss being fine, I really don't wanna *die.* 

I just wanna feel alive again and have some hope that I will be fine again."|1
"My therapist doesn’t understand how bad my relapse in depression is recently.
He downplays my recent spike in depression and panic all the time in sessions, even though he used to be so validating after I went to rehab last for my suicide attempt. 
He always compares me to past versions of myself, and ironically it pushes me more into my depressive episode.

I feel like Im getting back into a bad routine with my self harm. I’ve been clean for around  5 months, but most of the day I think about self harm, and using it for relief like I did when I was fourteen, (I now am 18).
My treatment “team” has not really been teaming with me, and constantly misunderstands what I say, and even assumes what I’m feeling lately. 
My psychiatrist is even worse, because he gets the last word with what happens with my brain chemistry. He is an awful excuse for a psychiatrist, but sadly I am stuck with him.

If anyone can give me any advice on how to get my therapist to genuinely listen to what I’m saying I would be eternally grateful."|1
"
Hi All, i am a young man turning 30 Soon and my life is a complete mess. 

I am on a social care in my country, have no formal education besides what i assume is equal to college in US as an example.

I have no friends or close intimate relationships beside my parents wich life i am ruining not intentionally but they cant barely function in there own life because am very dependent on them for anyone to talk to.

I am depressed, has very servere OCD and are both on SSRI zoloft and Hydroxzine an antihestamine for relaxation. 

I am addicted to nicotine products, coffee, and abuse alcohol to much like binge drinking on social gatherings when i am social at bars to escape my sad reality that is the only social connection i have to other people.

My apartment is a mess i cant make My own food do to OCD and cleaning makes me anxious.

I have a twin brother who is born with brain damage and my childhood was a bit lonely.

My last girlfriend got cancer and i was with her through All treatment and support for her and her family. She is well today.

I am very unhappy about being on my medication cause it numb me down to such a degree that i cant feel emotions or cry but only feel sad.

I feel guilty cause i am a very sensitive and kind guy but its like depression and my meds combined make me loose my emphaty and love for others wich is really not my genuine personallity.

I feel no motivation for anything but still i have this vision that i want a job, being a good Friend, Help and love people and have a girlfriend to share my life with, and just experience life instead of just being Alive. 

I feel so stuck and dont know what to do."|1
I’m so tired of people. It’s so hard to meet people as an ugly person, because everyone immediately thinks you have a disability. I’m so tired of the human race being so quick to judge people when they don’t know them. Like seriously? I try to be a nice guy, yet every time I try to talk to someone everyone walks away. I’m so sick of this miserable life. I’ve literally posted 3 times on this sub and have never gotten a response. I honestly don’t want a friend anymore. I just want people to know that I’m a nice guy, I’m just a little socially awkward. But whatever, it’s not like it’s gonna matter anyways.|1

My bf of 4 years broke up with me and I hate to say it but he was the only thing keeping me going. Now he acts like I never existed. I want to get in my car and drive as far away as I can.

"Well, it’s happened folks. I thought I was improving but then it struck. From a single night of bad sleep, I have now been unable to sleep well for the past week, and my depression has gone over the roof

It all started with my mom checking up on me whilst I sleep. I kept the door to my room open that night because dad was feeling a bit sick and I wanted him to come in case he felt too bad ( he has Coronary artery disease and has had a heart attack once too). My mom came in, woke me up and then we conversed a bit. Afterwards, I noticed that I didn’t finish my daily journal and then I tried to finish it. I felt too sleepy however and then I decided to hit the hay again. As I lay down however, I felt that I couldn’t sleep and eventually, had to take meds

Ever since that day, my sleep schedule has been going to shit. I was guilty for taking meds, viewing it as weakness since i didn’t need them for over a month. I had insomnia before but I beat it, which somewhat gave me consolation but still. Over the past few nights, I’ve been sleeping without meds and so I’m a bit happy. But at times, I’m so scared of sleeping that it turns into a vicious cycle

As for my depression, the insomnia is contributing to that. Every day, I keep excessively worrying about what I’ll do at bedtime. And when bedtime comes, I eventually can’t sleep at all. Even the slightest feeling of unease makes me feel like I’m about to die. 

I’ve typed this in a very anxious state. Sorry for the bad wording. I really need some help"|1
"2 weeks ago i came out to my family that i did this again. Its not first time or even 10th. I relapsed hundreds of time. One week later started gambling again. My mother can check my bank account and today she realised that something was wrong. 

She told me that she will control all my finances or its over(wont let me work at her office, wont give me money for therapy).I understand, but i prefer to hang myself then being in more control. You cant imagine what i feel through those years. I want to be independent, but addiction is killing me and my finances. Everyone around. 



Im 25.
 Cant move out from my parent's house cause of my addiction.

 I havent finished my university yet cause of my addiction.

Im depressed, every few months or even i want to shoot myself because i cant handle those emotions.


Therapy. Im on it but still failing. My ""record"" without gambling was 10 months.

And i want to break up with my girlfriend right now. She is the only happiness i have experienced through last year and i feel like i need to let her go. I dont want to hurt her more.


In one hour i have therapy and all i want is to kill myself. I just cant..I dont know whqt to do"|1
"I get that I'm not entitled to happiness, I have to suffer here like everyone else.

I get that I'm not entitled to love, nobody will ever feel for me the way I feel about them, there's no reason. That's just how it is.

I get that I'm not entitled to basic human decency.

I fucking hate this. All of it. Why am I still here?"|1
I’ve been a very happy person all my life. I’ve had some really fucked shit happened in my life but for some reason it doesn’t affect me the way it would affect most. All I’m saying is I don’t think the way I’m feeling has anything to do with my past, so I don’t want that as an excuse to why I’m feeling this way. Lately, I’ve just been feeling so anxious and depressed. Not over anything. Just it’ll come over me randomly and it’s like a impending doom. My body just sinks and my heart races and it’s over nothing, and I can never seem to calm in when it’s happening. My life choices are shit so if that’s the problem please please let me know. I get drunk with my friends about 3-4 times a week but I’m also 20. I am on my way phone way to much but it’s because it gets me away from that feeling of just absolute hopelessness. There is no reason behind this feeling it’s just a feeling I get. When I research it or hear people talk about depression it never seems to line up with what I’m feeling.|1
I feel like nothing and will continue to be nothing special  :( I just want to stop the world from hurting so much but I’m useless.|1

I’ve just come off fluoxetine for Health Anxiety, and now left with extreme weight gain and the worst depression of my life (and total body pain). Just ran out of a codeine, but a family member has a stash of Tramadol they no longer use. Just had 2 and waiting for effects. Anybody got any similar stories? Any advice to keep health risks low? Is it okay to use a minimal amount of Tramaldol to manage depression? (CONTEXT: my local doctors surgery was recently rated one of the most badly run in my area, and I’ve been let down by them time and time again)

I have never had faith in myself. I wonder, how is it like to want something and believe that you’ll receive it? Whenever I want to achieve something in my life, the voice in my head says “it won’t happen, you don’t deserve it, you know you’re not good enough”. I never thought I could reach the age of 25 and here I am on my 25th birthday. I guess I had this thought because I never believed that I could get a job, have a relationship and do adult stuff. I want something, I start working for it, then I give up. Because I don’t believe I can get there. I’m sorry for the rumblings but oh god. I’m so done with myself. I’m so so so tired. I’m such a downer. Such an asshole, constantly putting myself down. I got a diagnosis, received treatment (therapy and meds) but they didn’t do much help. I don’t know what to do. I’m just so done with myself...|1
Hello! I’ve been having heavy chest & occasional shortness of breath for months. My lungs are clear and also my Gastro said my endoscopy is clear &amp; just met with my Cardio and showed my 2D echo he said I have Mild Mitral Valve Regurgitation and said that it’s nothing to worry but I’ve been super worried with my heavy chest and also talked to my Psych and was diagnosed Generalized Anxiety &amp; Panic disorder w/ depression he prescribed me Zoloft. Anyone here experiencing heavy chest for quite some time? Is this a physical symptom of Anxiety/depression?|1
"I'll try to keep it short and simple. 

In 2019 I was happy. Then 2020 came around. My grandmother died, then my mom died two weeks later. My girlfriend really helped me emotionally in dealing with that for a while, but she broke up with me 6 months after that. Then a month after that, on thanksgiving, was the last time my father spoke to me. I spent this last winter at home drinking and smoking. I had no job,  barely any money, and no one to talk to about anything. I spent day after day with nothing but my thoughts; how I'll never make my mom proud and how I barely ever told her I love her, how shitty I was to my girlfriend(pretty shitty), and how my father hates me. I decided to make the move from ny to fl because a buddy of mine just got a place and wanted a roommate, and I never liked feeling down. Well besides the change in weather, nothing else has. I've been here for 3 months and still haven't made friends. I spend a lot of my weekends in bed if I'm not drinking alone at a bar. I feel like everyone that loved me is gone, and it's my fault. I feel like I'm nothing but a burden and liability to people. I've lost all motivation to do anything with my gf and mother out of the picture. I've considered taking my life but I'm too pussy to do it. I've never felt so lonely for so long and I'm tired of it."|1
I'm still new-ish behind the wheel and had a panic attack the first time I drove (not a great start), but I managed to overcome my nerves around it. But now I zone out while I'm driving, like I'm daydreaming without dreams. Unless I'm actively muttering to myself to wake up, I don't even notice until I go too far to the edge of the road and hear the gravel. I can't seem to snap myself awake enough to stay focused and alert. It kinda feels like when my social battery runs out and I struggle to stay engaged in conversation so I subconsciously give up and tune everything out. Like I don't have it in me to really be there. Has anybody else experienced this ? and any tips ?|1
Recently I’ve been barely eating. Once a day, twice at most. I have a fast metabolism and have been skinny all my life and I’ve been eating a lot to keep up with it since I’m constantly hungry. But I haven’t been eating a lot for a while. I’ll eat maybe 6 hours after I wake up and I’m used to starving all day. My parents ask me to eat but I just say I’m not hungry. I just don’t want to eat. I wanna starve to death|1
either that or i wake up from what was all just a nightmare|1
I recently started feeling depressed after some significant life events occurred. I had some days where I felt sad before, but this is different. I have thoughts about death a lot, not to the extent that I want to commit suicide but I just feel like dying wouldn’t be that big of a deal. It’s been almost 2 years now since this started, does anyone have experience of feeling normal again after experience something like this? I liked myself and enjoyed multiple hobbies before. Now, I wake up almost daily feeing directionless and unhappy. It’s overwhelming and I don’t know how — or if I can — get back to normal.|1
"Work makes me so terribly depressed but of course I have to work to eat and have a home. If it weren't for my kids I would quit immediately.

Nothing is enjoyable anymore because of how work down I am from work. It will never be worth it. Once the kids are out on their own I will never work again. I don't care what happens to me because of it."|1
"I took this week off work bc Mon is a company holiday and it expands my time off. Monday I just slept and read books. Tuesday I accompanied my sister on her errands. Yesterday, my sister and I used her new smoker/grill and I brought home a brisket, burgers, brats, and two kinds of chicken. I got to see her puppies again and play with them and see her nice house since my son and I moved out. It's now Thursday, my son's case manager is coming by the house today and I've JUST NOW started the arduous cleaning necessary. (He is in a behavioral intervention program for his own diagnoses.)

It's so much. The carpet is so gross, there are so many cans, trash, clothes, etc all over. I'm fat, too, so sitting on the floor to clean is really the only way I can do this. Which makes the carpet even grosser.

It's hard to find anyone to say these things to, so I'm saying it here. This stupid past year where I did nothing or the absolute bare minimum has given me so much to repair, clean, throw out. It's overwhelming. No one in my life really knows how bad it's gotten, so I can't turn to them for encouragement or support. Thanks for reading. Just trying to keep myself motivated and to not give up before half of one room is done."|1
I'm starting to lose my hold on time and reality. Everything is again starting to merge into one brown lifeless, useless and dull mess. I'm dissociating more. It's difficult to concentrate on anything or sit still for work. The pressure of studies, research and scholarship is starting to pile on. My lack of social skills feels like the biggest boarder to cross into the real world with healthy interactions and attachments. I'm getting lost again. I wanna cry. Don't like this one bit. I can't afford to breakdown right now but it's happening anyway.|1
Hey everyone. Do any of you feel like what's going with us has made you clumsy as well. I know that it's jacked up my short term memory, but I feel like everything I do is  I'm doing it with very minimal coordination. Someone please help.|1
Ye idk how to start so em. I think I have panic disorder. I’m pretty certain actually. But I don’t know how to tell my mom. My grandad just died. And it was the first time I saw my grandma break. I’m so tired. Honestly I wish I wouldn’t wake up again. But I’m scared of death. I want to be in the military. But my parents don’t agree on that. I just feel like doing nothing for a week or two. Cuz ye I’m getting all fucked up. And can only get help next week. Please help. Honestly I just want a pause from the world. But without death|1

"Hey everyone. To make a long story short, I've made many mistakes over the last couple of years. Some of them trivial. Some of them so severe that I can only speak about them with either a therapist or a lawyer. Some of mistakes are typically seen as forgivable. Some of them are widely deemed as unforgivable. 

I've been struggling to deal with my past transgressions and recently learned that I often go to others to forgive me; tell me that I'm okay. Maybe making this reddit post is an extension of that. 

But I've gotten to the point that some of my mistakes are no longer safe to share with other people due to the potential long-term consequences on my life. Essentially, I can't turn to others for comfort anymore. 

I'm moving into a new stage of my life, moving beyond the mistakes of my past and I'm trying to be strong enough for myself. How do I learn to forgive myself, to take care of my emotional conflicts without outside intervention, to move beyond the mistakes of the past? Thank you guys."|1
I cant get a decent job, I was unable to finishy studirs...everyone in my town mocks mr and thinks I am a loser, my own parents hate me..|1
I work, but I find everything else in life so shite. Like I'm a quiet guy so no one wants to interact with me and I can't make friends. Partly due to this and because my efforts aren't reciprocated. Other than that it seems like everyone but me has their life together e.g. everyone's found someone, enjoying life and gets it easier. At times I also want a relationship and then I find that too stressful so I don't see the point in life. Yes my mindset has change on the job front as I've matured and realised without that my life is butchered.|1
4 years ago I would only brush my teeth a few times a month this lasted for about 2 years and I was finally able to break the habit. I'm still depressed but I've managed to regularly brush my teeth every day. but even after brushing my teeth regularly, I'm still getting the same amount of cavities if not more than I was getting when I didn't brush them. I've been told it's because I'm still a teen and I have bad genes but idk. I would like some tips on gathering up the motivation to brush my teeth even when there are no physical results.|1
"I am a M 24 that is battling depression since I was 18 and recently moved to a different city for a work oportunity and met this amazing girl, that is now my fiancé. However, as depression goes, is sometimes hard to understand me, when I'm low or when I'm swimming in the lukewarm ocean that depression is. We've been working a lot on communication and clarity in our relationship, and it's hard for me to express my needs. I just told her that I need to feel supported and loved by her, especcialy when I'm goign through anxiety and depression. I told her that I will always be there for her and no matter how I feel, she can always come to me.  She said that she needs time to process this, but she doesn't really understands me.   


Do you guys have your own ways of comunicating your depression? How can I communicate my ocean better?"|1
Does anyone ever feel like they’re behind in life. Every time I’m on social media I see all of my peers getting married, kids or graduating college and starting careers I’m 20 years old if that helps. The other day I was laying in my bed room thinking about what’s the point of staying alive because I have nothing to show proof that I’m living a life that’s worth doing. I tried college and I failed twice and haven’t told my parents since it’ll be embarrassing since my older siblings graduated with honors. It seems everything I tried always leads up to nothing whether that be music, basketball, and college it’s just ends up nowhere and now I’m here counting my day till perish. I always try to find something to live for everyday such as watching the NBA playoffs, getting to Xbox with my friends or making oatmeal for breakfast.

"  

This is a bunch of ramblings that I have never written down before. I don’t know what I expect out of this but it is good to get it on paper. This doesn’t really have a flow but I tried to make it as concise as possible. This is also a warning of death, suicide, abuse, and so on. 

I’ve lived many lives but I have not known happiness.  I’ve had good times and bad times. Why were they good and why were they bad? What is the difference betwixt the two? I’ve tried mediation, yoga, exercise, travel, good eating and sleep. There is a monotony in life that makes me want to die. We keep running around and having sex and having more humans. We keep going to work and keep building and keep getting more and more and more. I’ve seen religion and brainwashing take a child and pick up his father’s AK only to be put down by my hand to protect my teammates. I’ve been on the way to work crying and wishing I would die only to walk in the doors clean faced and smiling. We all are going towards the same end, death. The stuff in between is great and terrible. It’s also just the same fucking bullshit over and over but done in a different way by a different person 300 years later. Every little thing making you want to buy my product, hate this one, don’t support this, fuck that, I’m right you’re wrong. Does it ever change? 

I had a decent childhood without abuse or trauma in the general societal norm sense. My mom and dad were both really young when I was born. My grandparents raised me and I appreciate everything they did for me. My dad never stayed with my mom. I didn’t know who he was until I was in my teens. I grew up in a home in the deep south that was religious, loving, racist, homophobic, caring, and stable. Do all those things go together? I don’t know but honestly as contradictory as that was that was the life I lived growing up. I never told anyone I didn’t hold the same hate for others that those around me did. I never told anyone that I loved everyone the same. I went to a church that taught love and compassion but would turn an eye to homeless, homosexuals, blacks, Asians, middle easterners, and anyone that wasn’t white or held the same belief they did. This put me at such an interesting place growing up seeing and hearing and being taught such contradictory things. I learned very quickly that those who had differing opinions were shunned and looked down upon and were worth less than the ground they stood on. 

I learned at the age of 3 that if the dog was more trouble than it was worth you killed it. I don’t believe this at all. My grandfather found a cat who had kittens under our garage so he shot them all. 

I learned at the age of 5 no matter how nice you are to those of your kind you should never help someone who could have just pulled their self out of their own situation (this just so happened to be anyone that did not hold the same belief or weren’t the same skin color). I can’t believe this is still gong on today. It’s astonishing that these things kept happening in my brain at the age. I grew up fast. It’s so confusing to love someone and hate them in the same beat. It’s so confusing to me now to not want someone to die because they are getting older but looking forward to the day when their ideologies are gone with their last breath. 

Age 8 I felt true loss for the first time. I did not cry when my dog got hit by a guy driving his sports car down the backroad where we lived too fast. I did not feel anger. I felt confusion as to why someone who valued their good time more than the time or feelings of others. My grandparents were confused why I didn’t cry. I loved our family dog. I could see on their face that me not crying was such an abnormality that I made myself cry. 

At the age of 9 I found out that I liked guys just as much as girls. Church camp, my best friend in the world I really loved but more than just another human. This was wrong by everything I ever knew. I also knew it was right and that it being wrong was only an ideation held by those who were so close minded and bigoted. 

At 10 I had my first girlfriend. My family was so happy. Would they be happy if they knew I wanted a boyfriend? I would and will never know. I had girlfriends, boyfriends (in secret), friends, best friends, associates, acquaintances, enemies, and everything in between. 

I had my first sexual experience with my best friend, I lost my virginity at 12 to my guy best friend. 

I cut myself for the first time when I was 13. I enjoyed it, I felt something… I thought? It was pain but it was good. I enjoyed that control I had over being able to make myself experience something. This was never for attention and was never for the intent of potentially killing myself. 

At 15 I got my permit and I had already been driving around my town. 

At 16 I had sex with my first female. Also while I was 16 I had my first save as a lifeguard. A human who was dead, drowned, brought back to life by my hand? I had 2 more saves by the time I was 17. I stopped cutting myself around this time. 

When I was 17 I had my first experience with alcohol. On our last day life guarding we had a party to celebrate the ending of the season. 

When I was 18 I graduated with academic honors with distinction. I had made a 31 on ACT, took 7 college classes prior to graduation high school. I played in the band and was invited for 3 summers in a row to different colleges to play during the summer to entice me to play for them after high school. I won many medals in solo and ensemble events. I have played in Carnegie hall. I love music. 

Well, after high school I decided to go to college. I had a scholarship for a full ride so why not. I was only the second to person to attend college in our family. My mom achieved her Masters so naturally I was supposed to right? I took fall, spring, and summer classes. I averaged 18-19 hours a semester and burned myself out. During that time I thought I was going to marry my girlfriend. I took classes in Nursing and went to the hospital to do observations and help in a small capacity. I saw death. I saw life. I saw people that hated their lives and wanted to die and I saw people that loved their lives and didn’t want to die. Death is something that comes to all with no bias. I got to help people pass on to their next adventure. I got to help people accept that sometimes no one wins. 

At 19 I decided I wanted to join the military. I joined the military and went to boot camp. I was with all walks of people and developed a deeper understanding of true compassion and love. I also developed my emotions to be more in check and be ok with killing others. To see that as a great triumph to protect my country and my new found friends. We were all in the shitty situation but we all had each other. This was the most brainwashed position I’ve ever been at in my life. My life isn’t more valuable than someone else? I was born here and they were born there so since our countries decided they didn’t like each other now I have to kill someone? Are you fucking kidding me? I thought about killing myself for the first time. Once I got out of boot camp and into my training I really learned the level of mental conditioning everyone was expected to be in. I was there and well past that point but I question everything. In my early years on the military I think back and wonder what happened. Sometimes it’s honestly hard to remember and it’s because of how much stress and anxiety I was under. I had a very important job and people’s lives depended on me doing my job right. 

I experienced in 2015 a death that I had no part in but was the first person on the scene. A motorcycle rider had pushed his limits too far and had paid the price. He wasn’t dead yet but I knew he was going to be soon. I know someone’s eyes when they are seeing their life in the past and are dissociated with the current reality. I’ve seen people survive incredible situations and I’ve seen people die at the smallest amount of trauma. This was a hard moment for me. I stabilized his body, cleared his airway, called medical services, administered CPR, and wrote in blood on his helmet what time I started. When paramedics arrived it had been 3 minutes since I started. He was hooked up to an automatic CPR machine and put on life support for 3 days before his body failed him. He had a wife and 3 kids. His death reminded me of when my dog was hit by the guy in his sports car. Only this time it was the guy driving who died and his family suffered. I wasn’t saddened by this and I wasn’t angry. Just again, like before, confused. 

I was such an outlier the entirety of my military service since I didn’t say “how high?”. I was never a rank grabber or a backstabber. I was never a model sailor in the militaries eyes. Was I good at my job? I was one of the best at my job. I took pride in what I did and I didn’t care about superiors, ranks, made up timelines, inspections (uniform and barracks). I was doing my job above and beyond, I was getting my certifications, I was destroying the PT tests, and I was a mentor to my junior sailors. I was thought of by every one of my superiors as a terrible sailor. Why? Because I didn’t shine my shoes, I didn’t do extracurricular, I didn’t volunteer to teach IW, I didn’t try and get my Pin. I was recognized by our director for being an outstanding service member who could work circles around everyone and whose training was above and beyond everything they could hope for. I was going to accept my award and shaking the chief’s hand he whispered in my ear that I was a shit sailor and a disgrace for not having my IW pin. I went to my OIC to shake his hand, he whispered in my ear that it was reprehensible to see me up here in front of my peers with no IW pin. I shook the director’s hand and he smiled and then whispered into my ear that my uniform looks like shit and my shoes look like someone took sandpaper to them. I smiled every handshake knowing that the rest of my military career would be this I wanted to die. The thought that this is not only my leadership but the leadership of my sailors was too much. This is the military and no matter what you do or what you have accomplished it will never be enough. 

I hate recognition. I hate going in front of anyone and accepting a medal or award or commendation because of something I’ve done. I do what I do for the benefit of everyone I might have an impact on. That day crushed my motivation to achieve anything else in the rest of my military career. 

Later that year I got hurt and my depression, weight gain, lack of wanting to do anything spiraled out of control. I was involved in an electrical explosion and wasn't by all means dead. Finally, my time to rest was here. I was saved by a teammate. Not my time yet I suppose.

I was put into 4 years of physical therapy. These were the hardest 4 years of my life so far. Having so much time to reflect on my past. Not having the ability to do anything to get away from my thoughts. I don’t know how many times I stopped myself from driving into traffic, falling off a cliff, not coming back up for air spearfishing, stepping out into traffic, cutting my wrists, shooting myself, or just disappearing. Those 4 years of my life are almost a blur. I do remember that I gained 90 lbs. in one year. I was waived from every PT test in my military career and nothing anyone ever did helped me. My chain of command didn’t believe that I was injured. My command didn’t believe I was hurt. Just suck it up! That’s all I was ever told. No MRI, CT scan, Physical therapy session or orthopedic specialist was able to tell me what was wrong. Still to this day I don’t know. It’s been 9 years now. Having something wrong and having everyone tell you over and over that you’re faking it, you’re a disgrace to the military, and you’re a malingerer. It’s dehumanizing. 

During my time in the military I got married, almost divorced, and my wife had our child. My wife deployed 9 months came back for 4 months and deployed another 8 months. During that she had a mental breakdown during the first deployment and became abusive to me verbally while she was gone and physically once she got back. We went to marriage counseling twice and that didn’t help. It was a temporary thing that always ended with her falling back into her anger. 

I came out to my wife that I was pansexual after she came back from her second deployment. She felt betrayed, disgusted, and had a hard time talking to me for the next couple months. I didn’t leave. It was a lot to tell someone who you've been married to 5 years now. I just felt like if I opened myself up more maybe it would make our relationship stronger. I was wrong. The years of being called a robot with no feelings. Chastised for not crying at something sad. Being empathetic for a homeless beggar only to be told he could get out of his situation if he tried. He just wants hand outs and he'll just buy drugs or alcohol with the money you give him. 

We are separated now, I had taken as much as I possibly could and could not do it anymore. 

In my time in the military I’ve seen people tortured, maimed, crushed, ripped apart, blown up, shot, dismembered, and at the end of it all the thing that hurts me the most is I have seen people take their own life after they are done. They can’t cope with what they have done, seen, or been a part of. I hate the things I’ve been part of, I hate the things we do as a military, I hate that someone somewhere places a value on someone else’s life, I hate the places I’ve been and the things I’ve been exposed to. Most of all I hate that I now have to live with it all. I hate that I dream about it, I hate that I lose friends every year to suicide. I understand why they take their life, I really do. 

Now that I am out of the military I have a great job and I have coworkers now that I wouldn’t trade anything for. I still don’t know true happiness. I’ve had new cars, old cars, rebuilt cars, built my home, sold my house, rented apartments, rented houses, and nothing out of that has given me happiness. I’ve experienced love, disgust, hatred, confusion, loss, betrayal, anger, elation, aloneness, and so on. My friend group was small, 1 close friend to this day. My acquaintance group was and still is small. I have had teachers, tutors, mentors, people to definitely not be like in any shape form or fashion and I’ve seen people that I can’t believe are as good as they are. I’ve seen life, death, disaster, miracles, hope, and all the emotions and situations that could almost possible be imagined. 

I’ve lived in other countries, I’ve traveled the world, I’ve learned other cultures, and I’ve held and practiced many many religions. I love and hate the world we live in. I love and hate the people that inhabit our planet.  I don’t know why I write this but it helps. I still have the desire to just stop breathing but also I still have the desire to help everyone that I possibly can in any way that I can. My brain is so contradictory sitting here and trying to rationalize everything. I have a Psychiatrist, Psychologist, and Therapist. I really enjoy those people but I think they are bandages on a symptom and not a fix for the problem. I’ve been on antidepressants, anti-anxiety medication, and mood stabilizers for almost a year now and they just aren’t doing the trick. My next step? I’m not sure. Post this? See what others say and go from there. I live a day at a time, an hour at a time, even minute by minute some days and that’s the best I can do.

Sometimes I wonder how much of this is actually real and how much of it is a warped  version of reality inside my head. The lines are becoming very blurred over time. Are my experiences the way things actually happen? Are my relationships actually what I think they are? Or do people lead me to believe they are? I don’t know what I’m saying|1
"I started for 3rd time in few years with brintellix 5mg, it's my second day and I kinda lost feeling of touch.

I thought it was my genitals only as I didn't feel nothing when touching, but I have to hit/pinch my arm or leg pretty hard to feel anything..any experiences like this? Thanks!"|1
"I really can’t get over how incredible he was as an artist, especially his last two albums. He helped me through the worst times, it’s the relatability that his music has. Music is my coping mechanism and Mac is one of those artists that writes about the bad times so perfectly. I wish he was still here to continue revolutionizing his own art. 

I hope someone here can relate with us here, his themes are too personal to discuss in my personal life.

"On past months I'm dealing with angry depression, basically I'm angry all the time and I hate everyone like I hate my friends, myself, family and random ppl in general. It's hard and exhaust to leave the house or talk to people, it's funny because I'm not sad, I'm not feeling sad or anything,  I can leave my bed and do some activities but I feel empty and ""hateful"" in general. I just want to hit/beat/curse/yell everything and everybody of course I can't and I'm 1.54 cm girl, I'm small I can't beat anything. My doctor gave me antidepressants and other drug to anger issues but it isn't working and now maybe I need to stay in the mental health hospital and I don't want to go. I hate my life."|1
"Hi all, this is my first post to reddit.

Firstly, I would like to address the fact that I understand this is a highly complex topic and no single answer can help alone, however just wanting to hear some stories of those who have suffered/are suffering similar experiences.

A bit about myself:I am a lonely individual;I have a partner, play recreational sport and am in my final year of university, however I really do feel alone. As I type this call for help I am drinking red wine and at times I do not want to exist anymore. I wouldn't say I'm suicidal as such but cant help from fantasising about not living anymore and what this would feel like (I understand it would have no 'feeling' as such and this is what leads to me constantly think about it... even though I am about to graduate into a noble profession, play sport, have a partner and try every single day to be as productive as possible and this hasn't reduced my thoughts about not being on the planet anymore??

How do you who have/are suffering from depression cope with these feelings? And what do you do to make yourself feel like you are in control of your life?

Just want to hear your stories. Stay strong"|1
First of all my English sucks Sorry for that , I’m not a doctor and I don’t have huge knowledge about depression I’m just going to share my story , For 2 years now I’ve been depressed ( the main reason I think is a betrayal by someone I considered a brother ) I’ve become addicted to smoking even though I have asthma , became addicted to alcohol , gained a shit ton of weight ( went for 74kg dit to 120kg In a year ) lost my friends respect and love , everybody looks at me different , I’m suspecting my gf is cheating on me , all I do is play video games and smoke all day , nobody talks to me I wake up with 0 messages on my phone , suicidal thought were creeping in everyday , I even got a heart condition ( irregular heart beats ) , I knew cigarettes were killing me I knew depression was killing me and I felt like I wasn’t controlling my body and my actions ( like that scene from the movie get out sunken place ) , Until I got so down deep low in life , rock bottom and I bounced back , it felt like either I bounce back and take back my life or I’ll basically die ( no joke smoking with asthma can turn ugly really fast) First thing I got rid of all toxic friends I have , quitted video games and social media pretty much , and finally got the courage to wake up and say fuck cigarettes , it felt like my mind was free , I started running everyday ( walking couldn’t run until later ) at 4 am , walking in the evening with no one but myself , healthy diet and start hitting the gym again , now thankfully I do feel a lot better i want to say to all the people reading this and struggling , i know my situation isn’t as hard as others but I do believe it gets better , never lose hope , you’re beautiful and special you need to fight and never let yourself down , whoever is reading this i believe in you the storm will go away|1
"I am so in love with my fiancé but I am not excited for our ceremony. I keep saying ""well it's just another day"" and I'm trying to get that mindset out of my head. This should be the happiest time of my life but with my mental illness and lack of emotional support from my family (they were never excited for me from the beginning), I am not excited and I'm the saddest I've ever been..please help 😔"|1
"I feel so guilty. I feel like all of this is my fault. This happened in October of 2020. So a pretty recent wound.  
There was this girl, let's call her Cristy. I met her over my school gmail cause I had a crush on her during 9th Grade but I never had the balls to introduce myself. She's ""popular, strong and attractive."" I'd always notice though she only had guy friends that she'd hug everyday. (There'd always be another guy she'd hug everyday.) It was weird because it seemed so foreign to me. So I assumed she was friends with everyone. So now, in 10th Grade, I finally talked to her on gmail since she was a remote learner at the time. We kicked it off, turns out we were so similar in every way except she's popular. I thought by then she'd run away from me because I struggled with depression, social anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Turns out, she also struggled with that as well. She just had come out of a relationship with a white dude named Devon. So she had it rough.  
She told me her past. She told me ALL of her secrets despite her not knowing me that well. She told me that she told me lots of things that her closest friends don't even know about.  
She said that I was lovable, cute and kind. And that I was different from everyone she knew in the past. One night after we started talking on Discord. She said. ""I know we just got to know each other but I think I like you."" She'd always send me heart emojis and everything.  
But then I started to get a little insecure when she added me to a GC with all her friends and they playfully roast each other. There was something one of her friends said that caught my attention (I too had suspicions of this.)  
Her friend said, ""So when are you gonna get another boyfriend for the next 2 months?""  
Eventually, she told me she was with lots of guys and one girl because she was desperate.  
So I was even MORE insecure cause my ""theory"" turned out to be true after all.  
It sucked. But I still had feelings for her. So in November I decided to tell her my feelings for her. I have never admitted my feelings to anyone before.  
I sent a video since I make cringe skits and vlogs for fun. And I explained to her that I want to date her because I love her a lot. And everything she's going through I'll carry her no matter what because it's my promise.  
She replied with, ""Sorry, but if my life wasn't so messed up maybe I'd date you."" I said ""oh, ok."" The next day she said, I feel so bad. Please don't hurt yourself.  
I wasn't but she was concerned. But I couldn't do this anymore. So I told her I needed some space.  
We stopped talking until one day. I accidentally found her at my school. ""She's an in-person student now?"" I was sweating like a pig. Thoughts were endlessly racing through my skull.  
We talked to each other once again. She talked as if nothing happened before. It was kind of sad but bittersweet.  
I actually was the happiest I ever was in a while.  
Then one day, (recently...) She said she had a boyfriend.  
What? What did I miss?  
So your life is together now? That was quick... You can't get rid of depression that easily. I'd KNOW, right?? But she figured it out somehow.  
Oh wait, turns out she is going through something. She told me she tends to hurt people when she dates them.  
Ok? So why are you with this new guy? Wait a minute, how long have you been with him? Was it this whole time? Or was it after we stopped talking. Either way, it was too damn quick and besides I thought you were suffering? I thought you were trying to ""protect"" me? So the same should apply to everyone else who asks you out?  
Or maybe it's because I'm not attractive, ugly and uninteresting.  
I asked her, ""Well, those guys you dated can't ALL be bad, right?""  
She said no. It was all her. It's only because these guys she's twisted couldn't live up to her fantasies. Those were her exact words.  
They couldn't do what?  
She always wanted to be an author but this is a bit too far. Too far.  
It stopped being about me and now it was about ALL the other GUYS. I'm not the only one, huh.  
SO what? This new guy lives up to her fantasy? I guess so.  
I gave her some advice... But I couldn't take it. I thought she was trying to fix herself, instead she's dating other people and destroying their lives.  
So I told her, ""thank you for all the bleakness.""  
Was I too harsh? Was I wrong? Do I need to apologize? What. do. I. do?  
And she was my ONLY friend. So now I'm all alone.  
(This is my first Reddit post. So I apologize if it was too long.)"|1
"I was dreaming I was in a high-story building - every time I was struggling, I jumped out of the window.

On the street below the building, there was a trampoline that appeared everytime I was about to touch the ground. The trampoline then sends me back up - but to a floor below the one I jumped from.

This process happened repetitively until I was at the ground floor and finally stopped jumping out of the window and found serenity.

I believe the 'jumping out of the window' was a metaphor for the build up of struggles I experience in real life and where it gets to a point where I can no longer handle it - but something stops me, and puts me back up on my feet and I feel ever so slightly closer to happiness in my life.

I see the jump as a quick way out and a way to the ground - but something keeps me ticking over and tells me to try again.


This is only one example of many metaphorical dreams that occur and I am sure these events in my dreams have profound meanings.

Thanks for listening/reading :)"|1
"So when I was a kid everything was fine until about 10 years old, my father left to look for better opportunities in another country, then everything started to crumble, my mom lost the house, had to live with my cousins, treated like shit and have been struggling ever since.

Eventually we were able to get out of living with other people but live in less that ideal conditions, full of health hazards but at least on our own. Dad got back, doesn't live with us but still tries to help. 

I always thought that by being responsible in school and getting a degree I was going to be able to provide my family of some sense of normality once again, but it's been a long time and everyday that passes just makes me feel more guilty. I live in a developing nation and so access to education is complicated in more ways than one, after I finished high school, the first thing I did was apply to college, after all that was the only way out of poverty, I was accepted in a school of my choosing and went there to get a degree in civil engineering, unfortunately the reality of my country hit me like a ton of bricks quite quickly in my first year and constant protest stopped me in my tracks, school stopped functioning for at least 6 months and so I had to get a job to support my family but the pay was pretty bad and didn't feel like I was doing nothing, always struggling at the end of the month, same shit as always. 

When schools started working again, I tried applying to a different school that wasn't as affected, was accepted once again and started all over, I've been in this school for 6 years now, I've been stopped 4 times more now due to protest and this has put me in a position where I'm now 26 years of age and still got no degree, no job, and my mom and I still live like shit. I can't shake the feeling that this is all my fault, I can't keep watching my mom living like this and I can't escape the thought that if maybe I wasn't so selfish by trying to get a degree in this shit hole country without opportunities I could've giving her a better life, this thought has make me depressed, seeing my mom and dad get older in this condition is killing me, I haven't had any friends since high school, expend my days trying and trying to finish this but there seem to be so many obstacles, I couldn't tell when was the last time I didn't feel like I was dying, like drowning in stress and agony, sometimes I don't even feel like I deserve to keep living, I'm such a failure man, nothing that I've done in my life seems like enough and I've tried. 

I still want to believe I've tried, I've studied like crazy, first compensating the failure that is this country's education system by getting up to speed with college, then doing research and being assistant professor for two classes while being here, learning to program and speak English by myself, but at the end of the day it all feels like a facade to hide my failures, when I get home the only thing I feel is guilt, the more my mom tells me she feels proud the worst I feel that this sad reality is still her everyday reality, she deserves so much better and I was the one that couldn't give it to her. 

Lately I've been applying to internships and no one really interested has called back yet, reinforcing this feeling of unwantedness. The ones that have called back I couldn't get for not having a vehicle or acceptable living conditions. In reality, most of the time now I just feel tired, I don't want to keep trying, everyday a problem to solve, every day a struggle with no solution in sight, the guilt is consuming the good things I had and just leaving this empty shell that I constantly feel like I am now. 

Thank you for reading this, I just needed to get it out of my chest."|1
I don't want to die. I just want to cease to exist in the past and present. I just wish I was never here in the first place.|1
"My family and I had to put our dog down a week ago today and it was easily one of it not the hardest and most heartbreaking experience I’ve ever gone through. Between watching the life fade out of him to watching my mom hysterically crying and then afterwards wondering if there was anything else she could have done for him and if she gave up on him (there wasn’t and she did not) it was so fucking horrible. 

I was at peak anxiety/depression before and during, but pretty much once the vet loaded him into the car and drove off (we had it done at home) I’ve been basically fine. Haven’t felt hardly any sadness and I’ll go the whole day without even thinking about him. Part of this is because he had been terminally ill for 3 years and I had been preparing for this for a while, but part of it is I think grief is often very delayed for me. My brain just can’t comprehend that someone/something is gone and that I’ll never see them again. 

A few months ago I went through a grieving period for my grandparents that was worse than when they passed away 4 and 6 years ago. I think a lot of this is just my brain trying to protect itself and honestly I’d rather just feel the pain and grieve now. I keep getting these quick and intense waves of sadness where my eyes tear up and I feel like I’m about to completely break down but then right before I get to that point the emotion is just gone, the tears stop forming and I just carry on like nothing happened. Sometimes I will intentionally think the saddest thoughts I can during these moments trying to get myself to cry but I just can’t, and I don’t like it. I want to cry for and grieve my dog. I know it’s in there somewhere and that I’m not just “fine.” I don’t want to be numb. 

Does anyone else experience this? What can I do?"|1
"i'm so unbelievably hurt right now. i don't even know what to say. we became really good friends last year and she was my very first internet friend. she developed a crush on me but i didn't know how to act because i hadn't understood my sexuality yet and i kind of tried to avoid flirting because i was worried that my parents might have found out that i was flirting with a woman online. 

we got along really well. we eventually had a falling out due to a misunderstanding on my side and i regret it so much right now. she was really the only reason i went on twitter at that time and the only person i interacted with. now a year later, upon logging on the very first tweet i saw was her sister tweeting from her account informing us that she had passed away two weeks ago and that she had been struggling with cancer for six months. i cannot fucking believe it. why is this world so awful? i'm so upset, i can't even function properly right now. 

i don't even want to talk to anyone about it because i know they'll most likely say i shouldn't be sad over an internet friend passing or give half assed responses because they wouldn't take it seriously.

my depression has been alright for a while but today, after hearing this horrible news, has really made me feel fucking awful. i know this pain won't last forever but it hurts a LOT right now.

wherever you are, my friend... i love you. i'm sorry for everything. thank you for being a part of my life. you shone sunlight on the rainy days and really made it worth getting up in the mornings... i'm sorry you gave life so much and this is how it repaid you. hopefully one day we will finally get to meet in the distant future. fuck... it hurts so much more than i thought it would. i'm sorry. i'm really sorry. i love you... so much. rest well, please..."|1
