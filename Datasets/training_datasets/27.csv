"@TheBloggess This is painfully relatable. Except that I've never had medication for my ADD. My parents were actively anti-medication, though not for everything, just anything related to the brain like ADD and depression. Which I have always had and have never ""outgrown"" as my parents hoped.",1
"Prepared to write essays on the topic ‘How I spent my lockdown?’  Well, the teachers are lucky because all they’ll read is essays about depression, melancholy, medication and deaths within the families.  Show us that you care.  #CancelAllBoardExams @DrRPNishank #cancelboardexams",1
"I suffer from the most intense migraines, anxiety, depression and PTSD. In my hand is all the meds I am allowed. There is no painkillers here. All this medication does is make me sleep, is this really how im expected to live?? Fighting sleep all day long..... I work!!!  https://t.co/brgfCmOFq0",1
Let me get this straight. A side effect of anxiety medication is depression and a side effect of anti-depressants is anxiety?? it's a vicious never-ending cycle.,1
this online class gives me more depression than ever  time to nut again for medication,1
My depression medication makes me more wholesome and cute :3 chuu~⭑  frightened by everything and every time someone I don’t know tries to talk to me I feel like I’m having a heart attack lmao  https://t.co/2PCIUBTY7p,1
"@charity479 I feel this. Been on every medication for depression, anxiety and mood stabilization. Some of these side effects are a bitch.",1
@PdxPestle Wonderful development! I’m so happy you have a diagnosis and medication for it 💜💜💜  I used Wellbutri as an adjunct to my Celexa when I was crashing hard from depression and anxiety. I do t remember any specific side effects because it was all to help me stop the slide.,1
If anyone has ever managed any techniques to deal with severe depression without medication please please tell me,1
"The morning is gone The dogs woke me after dawn Outside they all went. #TalkinHaiku #HaikuWisdom  to bed I returned Productive start? far from it Rest I have not earned. #meditation #veteran  the struggle is real, Imagination distracts #Depression attacks.",1
"@alphahelical @ZJAyres If you think it would be helpful, I definitely recommend talking to your therapist to get in touch with a psychiatrist - it doesn’t hurt to try to see if medication will take away some of your depression and anxiety",1
@ZJAyres @emerald1910 Totally agree. I take medication for depression and anxiety daily too.,1
I take medication every day to manage my depression and anxiety. It helps me stay well. I refuse to be ashamed of looking after me.,1
All I want to do is watch Star Trek Discovery and I keep getting commercials about depression medication. I’m ALREADY paying for your streaming service.  #ParamountPlus,1
"@novaonmobile1 @yhung_xx @DanielMccarten0 @jaiydenlol @JawboneKit @KEEMSTAR Okay then, forget the depression part. Look at seizures it can’t be cured by medication but only maintained. With medical marijuana it completely stops seizures in some cases. It’s also been proven to kill cancer cells. There’s so many other examples lol",1
"So mini me and I had a pretty major breakthrough this week.  She had wanted to look into medication for depression for the past few months, which I was against because her depression has always been situationally appropriate.",1
"Oh, the whole shebang: Autism, depression, anxiety, mild PTSD, self-harm, body dysmorphia and rejection sensitive dysphoria.  Thankfully therapy, medication and a massive support network of friends and family have helped me deal with it. #breakthestigma  https://t.co/UF4lYbJFPk",1
"obviously, medication isn’t going to work for everyone bc everyone’s situation and depression is different.   but if you’re considering it or you’re on the fence (like i was for like… 8 years), i cannot recommend it enough.",1
I’ve come to the realization over that week that I’ve never been sober. I’ve been on medication since I was 7 so yeah I’m starting to make correlations the difference between my sober self vs my high self,1
@siriusbff uhhh yeah this doesn’t sound right i take bupropion for my depression and a completely different medication for when i’m anxious idk what it’s called but what is her problem...,1
@beastyboyjae @is15horton @MinarchistKitty @AftPitsnipe @LethalityJane @tedcruz Idk it kinda just sounds like you have Aniexty and are on depression medication or something for it. And I totally sympathize,1
"Meditation has been big for me. I have struggled with depression since my teenage years, and I have found meditation to be the single most powerful antidote to allowing depression to drag my whole day down.",1
"@DrRPNishank SIR PLEASE CANCEL THE EXAMS.Sir i have lost one of my family member due to covid19.Along with all these, the exam pressure has taken me into a stage of depression and I am under medication now.I have already lost one and its difficult to risk others by getting exposed.",1
dad: I dont want you on anti depressants to help your anxiety and depression   dad: *has whole cabinet full of medication that is never ending*,1
@PissOffTrumpz I have depression &amp; I have been on medication for decades.  It took a few different ones  until I got the right one that worked for me. Still once in awhile I feel down but nothing like ending it all anymore.  You’re not alone ❤️  #MentalHealthMatters,1
@AngelaBarnes Yas! I’m 36 and just in the process of being diagnosed! I’ve just spent the last 6 years on medication for anxiety and depression but it’s done nothing for all my ADHD symptoms. The relief of knowing that this could finally be IT is real! I can now understand why I am the way am!,1
"Buddha was asked ,what have you Gained from meditation? He replied nothing however.let me tell you what i have lost : Anger.Anxiety, Depression.insecurity. fear of old age and death #happyworldmeditationday",1
@lrosebrillon @TheCriticalTru1 @busty01 @marinarados22 I don't want to know everything that is the point. I am on medication for anxiety and depression but I don't make a living out of it and I certainly would not trash my family in front of the whole world,1
"@AnoyingOnline Oh, no; I'm convinced my adhd medication actually made my depression much better (at first, at least). I was at ~ 9- 10/10 depression most of the day every single day for years &amp; was gonna kick the bucket but the med helped me get out of it. I think my dopamine was seriously low",1
"""biological sex"" is such a ridiculous concept. like what, ssri's don't work because i still have ""biological depression""?  all health problems are incurable i gues, medication is a conspiracy /s",1
"Also my mom had my aunt talk to me about it since she’s had similar issues &amp; wanted to give me the option to take medication, she ended up telling me that when she gets in her depression she’s never looked prettier LMAO bruh I look in the mirror depressed or not &amp; I start crying",1
Idk if I ever made a post about this month but May is Mental Health Awareness Month! Mental health is an important topic for me as I live with chronic anxiety and depression and am on medication to treat my illnesses! There are too many stigmas surrounding mental illnesses,1
@RaineriJason You have to do it on your own time. When you feel comfortable. Just FYI. You're not alone. I have depression and anxiety and PTSD from trauma. I spent some time in therapy and I take medication.  Diving deeper is not easy. Take your time.😊,1
Anyway today I’m feeling tired that my depression is definitely treatment-resistant as I taper off yet another medication. And frustrated that I know other options I think would work if I could just afford them. And stressed about finding out I have a hernia and need surgery.,1
"Fantastic to head D.J. Chark share his story. Like D.J., a combination of medication, counselling and opening up has done wonders to help me deal with depression and anxiety.  You are never alone. Your story matters.",1
"@KaeleeeTV Yeah I’ve been talking with a therapist also, I deal with anxiety and depression for sure but I might also deal with OCD but have never been diagnosed because I obsess over things! I just think I need to figure out what I need to do whether it’s natural or medication again!",1
depression is such a handicap. fr. If y’all are struggling with it please look into medication. I know it’s not for everybody but it’s helped me a lot. Obviously doesn’t fix everything but it will help you feel better and think clearer,1
"I have ADHD, anxiety and depression and have struggled with them since childhood. I’m thankful every day that I have access to medication that helps me live my life fully.   You never know what anyone around you is going through, &amp; I’m so proud you’re still here❤️#breakthestigma  https://t.co/MKI8Ww9RPD",1
"I have generalized anxiety disorder, depression up the ass (aka MDD), and ptsd for sleeping. I've been on my medication for almost 5 months now, completed 1 year of therapy with a new therapist, and I've been practicing cbt. I'm feeling better nowadays :)  #breakthestigma",1
"No mattr how many times the days come brighter there is always the shadow of #depression, it took me a while to understand it is a lost fight until there is a cure because symptoms mutate from medication to medication, I want out, I'm not strong, rooting 4 #suicide but what else?",1
"@MaddieMorrisVA I have been diagnosed with depression since high school. Medication helps, but I still struggle. To be honest, I've had huge trouble forming relationships with others because of low self worth. Sometimes I feel like everyone hates me and I'm going to die alone...",1
@iamkillbill I was forced to see a therapist and take medication for depression and anxiety and aspergers shit like all my childhood and as soon as i moved out a couple years ago i stopped it all but now that its a choice im about to get a new psych cuz they do help tho. Wanted to try without,1
"@WhatTheADHD 15, when my depression finally got so bad I was sent to a therapist. And 23, and 28, and 31, and 34 which are all ages I sought help for my mental health, described ADHD traits and was told I was depressed and that the medication would stay working soon.",1
"A lot of people think I’m a fully functioning adult; I have a good paying career and a happy relationship but I’ve struggled with anxiety, depression and ADHD my whole life. I’m now on medication and I go to therapy. It is a daily challenge, but you are not alone. #breakthestigma",1
"what medication has helped y’all with your depression &amp; anxiety? i tried prozac and hated it, lexapro was fine, and now i might try wellbutrin but i am scared because i heard it may make your anxiety worse 🙃",1
