"when I got #suicidal from the constant attacks, invalidation &amp; intrusion into my private life, I was told I was ""not suicidal"" and ""that's your choice"" and nothing changed except my life got MUCH worse &amp; smears got more severe. #mentalhealth #abusesystem #nhs #discrimination",1
"everyone says to ask for help,but the only reason I am #suicidal is bc I asked for help.First I said I was tired then had digestive problems,got lied to I had #depression, got attacked for ""not getting better"" then refused access to healthcare,services &amp; #complaints #MentalHealth",1
"At least once a week (I don’t check twitter every day) I see a tweet that suggests someone is dangerously depressed, suicidal, or just really, really sad. Random strangers in my feed. I can’t ignore them. I want to, but I can’t. 1/3 #suicidal",1
"#T11 Young husband looks for me, we met last night talked for about 4hrs, he was sobbing, tears running from his eyes and nose, sniffing and sneezing and exhibiting all these #suicidal thoughts &amp; revealing them to me. He is in ""SHOCK &amp; AWE MODE""😭🙆‍♂️ All I did listened attentively",1
"When bad stuff happened to me I was scared out of my wits re online threat, asking for help from unsafe people, &amp; scared of spouse that forced medical treatment on me that added damage #akathesia #suicidal  You never know what people are going through-maybe nothing to do with you",1
"Just once I would like to have a #HappyWeekend where I have no #suicidal thoughts, no #depression and no #anxiety. Where I didn't feel completely #alone and #helpless, where I had a sense of #selfworth and could feel #gratitude for the good things, instead of dwelling on the bad",1
"For me, that #fridayfeeling is usually one of dread, fear, panic. It marks the start of a weekend of dark thoughts, of toying with the idea of leaving this world. Thoughts that are with me all week, but seem to intensify at the weekend. #suicidal #alone #mentalhealth",1
"Need to get up early to head to the #postoffice in the morning (if they're open), but I suspect it'll be another sleepless night as my thoughts turn to #suicide, as I stare into the darkness, hoping for an answer that'll never come. #alone #help #suicidal",1
"I suspect my tweets will be nothing more that a record of a jumbled mind once I'm gone, a garbled mess of words and thoughts, incomprehensible to anyone unfortunate enough to happen upon this page. #suicidal #MentalHealthAwareness #alone",1
"Oh some days being #suicidal is a huge motivation. It makes me want to rise up, to work towards something, to get out of the rut. Other days, it pushes me down into dirt. It's a constant battle, and it only needs to win once! #suicide #mentalhealth #loneliness #debt #depressed",1
"I hate feeling like I'm wallowling in self-pity. I hate showing that self-pity. I'd rather keep it to myself, as I always have. At times I can snap myself out of it. Other times it lingers and builds up. #suicidal #alone #Help",1
"It feels like my voice is drowned out by all the background noise, by the sound of all these other voices, voices that matter, voices that people care about. I'm standing on the outside, hoping I can find a gap. No one is answering, no one can hear me. #alone #suicidal #scared",1
I #overshare because I’m constantly #suicidal. But dammit I’m gonna live! I’m too damned stubborn.,1
Every day I have suicidal thoughts and I just don't want to live. Nothing at home is my sanctuary. I don't want to wake up. Just to take my pills and go to a peaceful sleep and never wake up. I wish I wish #suicidal #toxic #family #depressed #getmeoutofhere #help,1

"At least once a week (I don’t check twitter every day) I see a tweet that suggests someone is dangerously depressed, suicidal, or just really, really sad. Random strangers in my feed. I can’t ignore them. I want to, but I can’t. 1/3 #suicidal",1
"#T11 Young husband looks for me, we met last night talked for about 4hrs, he was sobbing, tears running from his eyes and nose, sniffing and sneezing and exhibiting all these #suicidal thoughts &amp; revealing them to me. He is in ""SHOCK &amp; AWE MODE""😭🙆‍♂️ All I did listened attentively",1
"When bad stuff happened to me I was scared out of my wits re online threat, asking for help from unsafe people, &amp; scared of spouse that forced medical treatment on me that added damage #akathesia #suicidal  You never know what people are going through-maybe nothing to do with you",1
"Just once I would like to have a #HappyWeekend where I have no #suicidal thoughts, no #depression and no #anxiety. Where I didn't feel completely #alone and #helpless, where I had a sense of #selfworth and could feel #gratitude for the good things, instead of dwelling on the bad",1
"For me, that #fridayfeeling is usually one of dread, fear, panic. It marks the start of a weekend of dark thoughts, of toying with the idea of leaving this world. Thoughts that are with me all week, but seem to intensify at the weekend. #suicidal #alone #mentalhealth",1
"Need to get up early to head to the #postoffice in the morning (if they're open), but I suspect it'll be another sleepless night as my thoughts turn to #suicide, as I stare into the darkness, hoping for an answer that'll never come. #alone #help #suicidal",1

"Oh some days being #suicidal is a huge motivation. It makes me want to rise up, to work towards something, to get out of the rut. Other days, it pushes me down into dirt. It's a constant battle, and it only needs to win once! #suicide #mentalhealth #loneliness #debt #depressed",1
"I hate feeling like I'm wallowling in self-pity. I hate showing that self-pity. I'd rather keep it to myself, as I always have. At times I can snap myself out of it. Other times it lingers and builds up. #suicidal #alone #Help",1
"It feels like my voice is drowned out by all the background noise, by the sound of all these other voices, voices that matter, voices that people care about. I'm standing on the outside, hoping I can find a gap. No one is answering, no one can hear me. #alone #suicidal #scared",1
I #overshare because I’m constantly #suicidal. But dammit I’m gonna live! I’m too damned stubborn.,1
Every day I have suicidal thoughts and I just don't want to live. Nothing at home is my sanctuary. I don't want to wake up. Just to take my pills and go to a peaceful sleep and never wake up. I wish I wish #suicidal #toxic #family #depressed #getmeoutofhere #help,1

@depressed_ash_ Losing all my friends and my parents are driving me crazy,1
Also I think you must be sick in your head to set a meeting every Saturday 6:30am to 10 am....are you depressed??!,1

@slimethree___ @king_jaeb Where you at because I been depressed this whole week/my entire life,1
My parents refusing to believe that I might be depressed because they want to believe that they are great parents and that nothing could ever go wrong.  Look at the scars on my arm and tell me whether something went wrong or not.,1
they’re all very depressed and insane they remind me of sally from ahs: hotel,1
@LouLouLa10 Do us all a favour and end it. I been unhappy depressed for years yet have I once moan about other to others. Best thing for you is to end it. Asnoone caresin UK for you anymore,1
Remember in the early 360 days when games were like “the Totino’s Pizza Roll ad in your game will make the world feel more real” and we were all like fuck yeah I love Totino’s Pizza Rolls and now fast forward and ads are everywhere and we’re all depressed,1
