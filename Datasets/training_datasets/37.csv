@PdxPestle Wonderful development! I’m so happy you have a diagnosis and medication for it 💜💜💜  I used Wellbutri as an adjunct to my Celexa when I was crashing hard from depression and anxiety. I do t remember any specific side effects because it was all to help me stop the slide.,1

@QuadLazr There's too big a stigma about medication for depression. I've fought depression my whole life and for several years I was losing. Bupropion gave me the strength to climb out of the pit and the momentum I needed to leave it behind me.,1
Real talk (and a little funny) about mental illness. I have different mg of my depression medication for morning and for night. I labeled the caps like so and I always do a little song in my head. It’s time for the *~~~~night depression ~~~~* dah dah dah *jazz hands*  https://t.co/c5vAk6CnFP,1

My depression hit me with the full “you’re going to sleep extra and be super tired” and “you’re not going to eat” today. I’m going to blame it on the upped dose of medication to avoid the fact it’s probably more proof that my swings are worsening.,1

"@YASoOo_91 if it is depression... I don't know how to help lol I've been emotionally and physically drained for months now. You need to try meditation and all those anti - depression practices, maybe one of them would work for you",1
"I resisted medication because I thought it'd make me less human, less creative. I tried everything else. Working out (I got jacked af), eating well, meditating. Still wasn't enough.  I doubt anyone'd admit it but I think my anxiety and depression drove some friends away.",1
@GottaCallLee I have suffered with depression undiagnosed from 10 years old to 42 years old. I always thought I was fatigued but the truth is that depression and anxiety take a lot of energy from you. I have found meditation and exercise to be the best remedies.,1

@PdxPestle Congratulations on the diagnosis and medication. So many people are quick to eschew meds but they can be a life changer/saver. I was told I had chronic depression in my early 20's but that didn't cover everything. I did not get a diagnosis for bipolar disorder until I was 36!,1
