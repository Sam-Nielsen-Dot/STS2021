@ArtistJoyJo I have had clinical depression all my life so my treatment is sadly medication.,1
"@florieADHD @AskADHD My symptoms got worse. My depression is very mild but I had some low moments on that medication. Worse focus, sleep, tired all the time, no appetite etc. all got worse. Hopefully it works for you better than it did for me!",1
My depression hit me with the full “you’re going to sleep extra and be super tired” and “you’re not going to eat” today. I’m going to blame it on the upped dose of medication to avoid the fact it’s probably more proof that my swings are worsening.,1
"I’m falling apart. First it was constant depression. Then it was constant anxiety. Now it is headaches the entire day that pain medication can’t help with.  I don’t know what to do anymore.  I’m gonna head to bed for the night...  Much love, Rune 💛",1
"I struggled on a daily basis. But everything shouldn't have to be a struggle. I don't want struggle to be my baseline for success. If I'm diagnosed, I potentially could get medication to help me struggle less.  Maybe fewer struggles might help my depression!  (6/7)",1
"@BotanyDad @noahvbuckley @eyesonthestorm I have. But I was dealing with crippling depression that brought me back to my oppressive suburban hometown of Shoreline, WA.

"I resisted medication because I thought it'd make me less human, less creative. I tried everything else. Working out (I got jacked af), eating well, meditating. Still wasn't enough.  I doubt anyone'd admit it but I think my anxiety and depression drove some friends away.",1
Warning⚠️: I am on a medication withdrawal for something I have been taking for depression for over half my life. Please ignore any random nastiness or bouts of uncontrollable sobbing. I love you all! 💕,1

"@sjianna Thanks. Yup. I can deal with life's challenges. For me, the struggle has been with lifelong, medication-resistant depression. I've considered Electroconvulsive therapy, but decided against it. It's all good. I believe the worst of depression is behind me.",1
@poetguygabe Boat life must suit you! I’ve had depression from a young age. Diagnosed at 21. It never really goes away. I manage it with medication and therapy!,1

"@alphahelical @ZJAyres If you think it would be helpful, I definitely recommend talking to your therapist to get in touch with a psychiatrist - it doesn’t hurt to try to see if medication will take away some of your depression and anxiety",1
@ZJAyres @emerald1910 Totally agree. I take medication for depression and anxiety daily too.,1
I take medication every day to manage my depression and anxiety. It helps me stay well. I refuse to be ashamed of looking after me.,1

@PissOffTrumpz I have depression &amp; I have been on medication for decades.  It took a few different ones  until I got the right one that worked for me. Still once in awhile I feel down but nothing like ending it all anymore.  You’re not alone ❤️  #MentalHealthMatters,1
@AngelaBarnes Yas! I’m 36 and just in the process of being diagnosed! I’ve just spent the last 6 years on medication for anxiety and depression but it’s done nothing for all my ADHD symptoms. The relief of knowing that this could finally be IT is real! I can now understand why I am the way am!,1

"@AnoyingOnline Oh, no; I'm convinced my adhd medication actually made my depression much better (at first, at least). I was at ~ 9- 10/10 depression most of the day every single day for years &amp; was gonna kick the bucket but the med helped me get out of it. I think my dopamine was seriously low",1

Idk if I ever made a post about this month but May is Mental Health Awareness Month! Mental health is an important topic for me as I live with chronic anxiety and depression and am on medication to treat my illnesses! There are too many stigmas surrounding mental illnesses,1
Anyway today I’m feeling tired that my depression is definitely treatment-resistant as I taper off yet another medication. And frustrated that I know other options I think would work if I could just afford them. And stressed about finding out I have a hernia and need surgery.,1
